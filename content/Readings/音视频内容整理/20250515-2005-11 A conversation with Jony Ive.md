[A conversation with Jony Ive - YouTube](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wLb9g_8r-mE&pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD)

> [!summary]
> 这次Jony Ive与Patrick Collison的访谈，其核心重点可以总结为以下几个方面：
> 
> 1.  **设计的核心是“关怀”与“服务人类”：**
>     * Jony Ive反复强调，设计的根本目的在于体现对人的关怀，努力“真诚地提升人类”（sincerely elevate the species）。他认为，即使是微小的细节（如包装盒里的线缆如何取出），也应该让用户感受到“有人在乎我”。
>     * 他将设计视为一种向人类表达感激之情的方式，这种理念源于史蒂夫·乔布斯。
> 
> 2.  **硅谷的变迁与价值观的坚守：**
>     * Ive回忆了90年代初硅谷的“天真愉悦”和以服务人类为导向的价值观。他认为如今的硅谷更多被金钱和权力驱动，初心有所偏离。
>     * 他强调创作者需要坚守 foundational values（基本价值观）和清晰的目标感（enable and inspire people）。
> 
> 3.  **创新与设计的真正含义：**
>     * 创新不是为了不同而不同，或为了打破而打破，而是要创造出“更好”的东西。
>     * 简约（Simplicity）不是简单地移除杂乱，而是简洁地表达事物的本质、目的及其在我们生活中的角色。设计中应包含喜悦（Joy）和幽默感。
> 
> 4.  **团队建设与创意过程：**
>     * 创意团队至关重要，需要建立在信任、关爱和深刻的 auténtic（真实）关系之上。
>     * 强调“倾听”的重要性，特别是那些安静的人可能拥有伟大的想法。
>     * 提倡“为彼此制作东西”（make things for each other），无论是早餐还是原型，这能培养团队文化，使人脆弱、感恩。
>     * 在家庭等非传统工作环境中工作，能改变思考方式和关注点。
> 
> 5.  **警惕“可衡量性”的陷阱：**
>     * 人们倾向于讨论容易用数字衡量的产品属性（如成本、速度），这可能导致一个“阴险的谎言”——即认为这些可衡量的东西才是唯一重要的。而设计中许多关乎体验、愉悦感等重要贡献是难以量化的。
> 
> 6.  **科技的责任与非预期后果：**
>     * 创新必然伴随非预期后果，即使初衷良好，创作者也需要为可能产生的不良影响承担责任。
>     * 当今科技发展速度过快，使得社会讨论和适应往往滞后。
> 
> 7.  **美与人性的感知：**
>     * 美并非与实用性对立；如果东西不好用，它就是丑陋的。
>     * 用户能感知到产品中是否蕴含“关怀”（care），即使是产品内部看不见的地方也应精心设计，这体现了创作者的真实品格。
> 
> 8.  **为何所有企业都应关心设计（以Stripe为例）：**
>     * 关心设计是关心人的体现，是一种责任和荣幸。这并非商业策略的选择，而是作为“物种成员”参与社会的基本方式。工作和爱是人生的核心，通过工作表达关怀至关重要。
> 
> 总而言之，Jony Ive强调设计的核心在于深层的人文关怀、明确的价值观导向、对细节的极致追求以及由此产生的愉悦体验。他认为这不仅是创造伟大产品的途径，也是创作者和企业应尽的社会责任。

## Jony Ive Interview with Patrick Collison - Bilingual Transcript

English:

I'm very excited about this interview. There are few people in the Valley who need, or in the technology industry more broadly, who need less of an introduction than Johnny. And it struck me as I was about to walk on here that he barely even needs a surname. Please welcome to the stage Sir Johnny Ive. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] All right. So, well, thank you for joining us.

中文：

我非常期待这次采访。在硅谷，或者更广泛地说，在科技行业，很少有人比约翰尼更不需要介绍了。就在我准备上台的时候，我突然意识到他甚至几乎不需要姓氏。有请约翰尼·艾维爵士上台。[掌声] [音乐播放] 好的。那么，非常感谢你加入我们。

English:

I really would love to say that I am unspeakably grateful and honored to be here. Spending any time with Patrick is a big deal, so thank you.

中文：

我真的想说，我非常感激和荣幸来到这里。能和帕特里克共度时光是一件大事，所以谢谢你。

English:

Well, I want to start sort of in the obvious place. Just, I mean, you didn't-- I don't know if you got to kind of walk the floor and everything, but you can see sort of a little bit here. And you had the monitor backstage and so forth. And what do you think of the design? [LAUGHTER]

中文：

嗯，我想从一个显而易见的地方开始。我的意思是，你——我不知道你有没有机会到处走走看看，但你可以在这里看到一点。而且你在后台也有显示器之类的。你觉得设计怎么样？[笑声]

English:

It's lovely, isn't it? No, it's very-- do you know, I've not been here-- I haven't been here for a long time. And I have some very strong and vivid memories of being here. But no, the design's lovely. [APPLAUSE] The first event I ever came to in San Francisco was one that you designed where the author behind. It was the WWDC. And I have to go back and check. I think it was '05, maybe it was '06. But that was the first event I came to in San Francisco. And it was-- actually, I want to say it was here in this room at Moscone. But actually, John got to be in here, but I was relegated to the overflow room. Which was not my fault.

中文：

很可爱，不是吗？不，它非常——你知道吗，我没来过这里——我已经很久没来这里了。我对这里有一些非常强烈而生动的记忆。但是，不，设计很可爱。[掌声] 我第一次来旧金山参加的活动就是你设计的，作者在幕后。那是WWDC。我得回去查一下。我想大概是05年，也可能是06年。但那是我第一次来旧金山参加活动。而且——事实上，我想说当时就在莫斯康尼中心的这个房间里。但实际上，约翰进去了，我却被安排到了分会场。那不是我的错。

English:

All right. So speaking of that, you came to Silicon Valley in 1992. That right? That's right. Yeah. So you're still very young. But that was a couple of years ago, a couple of decades ago. How has-- how is Silicon Valley-- so Alan Kay says that the software industry and the computing industry is a pop culture, in the sense that we are ahistorical. And we don't understand the ideas and the antecedents and the things that came before us. And that's Alan Kay's view. I don't know if it's right. But I thought it was an interesting idea. And certainly, it's the case that if you ask people-- I don't know-- to-- in many industries, the greats and the creators and so forth are these kind of big, hallowed names. But if you ask people who invented the internet, a lot of people in the technology industry don't have a clear sense of that history. I've always had that kind of phenomenon interesting. But since you've now got to observe Silicon Valley for 33 years, how has it changed?

中文：

好吧。说到这个，你1992年来到硅谷。对吗？是的。嗯。所以你还很年轻。但那是几年前，几十年前的事了。硅谷——阿兰·凯说软件行业和计算机行业是一种流行文化，因为我们缺乏历史感。我们不了解之前的思想、先例和事物。那是阿兰·凯的观点。我不知道它是否正确。但我认为这是一个有趣的想法。当然，如果你问人们——我不知道——在许多行业，伟人和创造者等等都是些如雷贯耳的名字。但如果你问人们谁发明了互联网，科技行业的许多人对那段历史并没有清晰的认识。我一直觉得这种现象很有趣。但既然你已经观察硅谷33年了，它发生了怎样的变化？

English:

Well, I think when I was at art school, so I studied design in England. I was born in London and studied up in the Northeast. And I remember discovering the Mac in my final year, sadly. I wish it had been earlier. But I came to realize something that was-- I should have realized earlier-- but that what I realized was that what we make stands testament to who we are. And what we make describes our values. It describes our preoccupations. It describes beautifully succinctly our preoccupation. And this struck me so powerfully when I saw the Mac.

中文：

嗯，我想当我在艺术学校的时候，我在英国学习设计。我出生在伦敦，在东北部学习。我记得很遗憾地在最后一年才发现了Mac。我希望更早一些。但我开始意识到一些事情——我本应该更早意识到的——那就是，我们所创造的东西证明了我们是谁。我们所创造的东西描述了我们的价值观，描述了我们关注的事情，它优美而简洁地描述了我们关注的事情。当我看到Mac的时候，这一点深深地打动了我。

English:

And I got a very specific sense. Because it was a kind of bicycle for the mind, that aspect of it or something else? It was every part-- I got a very clear sense of a group clearly of original thinkers with clear values completely-- I think obsessed with people and culture. You can look at something and it can tell you, I was designed, to me, a price point at a certain time. So I hit the schedule. We can repent at our leisure. And it's as cheap as we hoped. Or you can try and design something that genuinely attempts to move the species on. And I had a very clear sense of the latter, that this was created by this renegade group in California.

中文：

我有一种非常具体的感觉。是因为它是思想的自行车，是这方面还是别的什么？它的每一个部分——我非常清楚地感觉到，这是一群显然具有原创思想、价值观清晰、并且我认为完全痴迷于人和文化的团队。你可以看着某个东西，它会告诉你，对我来说，它是在某个特定时间点为某个价位而设计的。所以我赶上了进度。我们可以从容地后悔。而且它和我们希望的一样便宜。或者你可以尝试设计一些真正试图推动人类进步的东西。我对后者有非常清晰的感觉，那就是这件东西是由加州的这个叛逆团体创造的。

English:

And so powerful-- I mean, I studied industrial design. I didn't study technology. But I was so moved by the clear values and the resolve and the courage that I think enabled the embodiment of those values that I wanted to meet these people. I wanted to come out. And so after college in '89, I first came out. I had to return-- this is probably way too much information. You're among a couple of friends. Exactly. This is a small intimate part I just-- Well, the interesting thing was that I had a job commitment. I was sponsored through college. And so I had to go back to work in design in London. And there was a strange liberty, I think, that afforded me. I was impossibly shy. And I think if I'd been traveling out to meet people with the goal of getting a job, I would have found that so anxious making, I don't think I would have dared to meet people. And so because I had no agenda, I think also-- I think people were probably happier to meet me because they didn't think I wanted anything.

中文：

而且如此强大——我的意思是，我学的是工业设计。我没有学技术。但我被那种清晰的价值观、决心和勇气深深打动，我认为正是这些使得那些价值观得以体现，所以我很想见见这些人。我想出来。所以在89年大学毕业后，我第一次出来。我不得不回去——这可能信息量太大了。你们就像几个朋友一样。没错。这只是一个小小的私密部分，我只是——嗯，有趣的是我当时有工作承诺。我大学期间有赞助。所以我必须回到伦敦从事设计工作。我认为这给了我一种奇怪的自由。我非常害羞。我想如果我当时是为了找工作而去见人，我会觉得非常焦虑，我想我可能不敢去见人。所以因为我没有任何目的，我想——我想人们可能也更乐意见我，因为他们不认为我想要什么。

English:

And so to dare to get close to answering your question, what I saw in '89, '92, when I finally moved out-- Apple, I worked-- I consulted for Apple for a couple of years. And then they persuaded me to move to San Francisco-- to move to Apple here. What I saw, I think, was-- or what I felt-- was a sort of an innocent euphoria, I think, of like-minded people driven by values clearly in service of humanity, gathering together in some small groups, in some huge groups. But I do believe there was a very strong sense of purpose. And that purpose was, we are here to serve the species.

中文：

所以，斗胆尝试回答你的问题，我在89年、92年，当我最终搬出来的时候——苹果公司，我工作过——我为苹果公司做了几年顾问。然后他们说服我搬到旧金山——搬到这里的苹果公司。==我想，我所看到的——或者我所感受到的——是一种天真的兴奋感，我想，是一群志同道合的人，被明确为人类服务的价值观所驱动，聚集在一起，有些是小团体，有些是庞大的团体。但我确实相信，当时有一种非常强烈的使命感。而那个使命就是，我们在这里为人类服务。==

English:

And was that at Apple in '92, or in the technology industry in '92, or in the Bay Area in '92? That's a great question. ==I think, honestly, Patrick, it was everywhere. I felt-- and even though there were competitors, even though-- I did feel that there was an underlying sense of our place as servants and of principled service.==

中文：

那是在92年的苹果公司，还是92年的科技行业，还是92年的湾区？这是一个很好的问题。老实说，帕特里克，我觉得无处不在。我感觉到——即使有竞争对手，即使——我确实感觉到一种潜在的意识，即我们作为服务者的地位和有原则的服务。

English:

And what's changed? Well, I don't think that's the case entirely. I think there are agendas that are about-- well, there are corporate agendas, I think. And this will sound a little harsh, but it is, driven by money and power. And I think, if you know how you tend to get-- you end up somewhere by sort of increments, I think if you were to starkly contrast today with '92, I think that would be a reasonable assessment.

中文：

那么有什么变化呢？嗯，我不认为情况完全如此。我认为有些议程是关于——嗯，我认为是企业议程。这听起来可能有点刺耳，但事实如此，==它们是由金钱和权力驱动的==。而且我认为，如果你知道你是如何一步步走到某个境地的——你最终会通过某种渐进的方式到达某个地方，我想如果你将今天与92年进行鲜明对比，我认为那会是一个合理的评估。

English:

And for anybody creating software, creating a product, creating a company, what's the center, or what's the north star that you perceive as having gotten a skew today, or the thing that people should hold firm to in order to avoid some of these failure modes? Is it what you just mentioned, having a clear sense of purpose? Is it sort of having a kind of servant orientation? How would you think-- what's at the heart of it?

中文：

==对于任何创造软件、创造产品、创办公司的人来说，你认为当今偏离了轨道的中心或指路明灯是什么？或者说，为了避免这些失败模式，人们应该坚守的是什么？是你刚才提到的，拥有清晰的目标感吗？是拥有一种服务导向吗？你会怎么想——它的核心是什么？==

English:

I think there need to be foundational values and an understanding of our place in all of this. And having a clear sense of the goal, which is to enable and inspire people. I mean, Patrick and I were talking just a while ago about being tool makers. And I'm very clear and very proud that that's my occupation and that's my practice. I love trying to move things forward, which means innovating. I have a real issue with-- I think people confuse innovation with being different or breaking stuff. I have no interest in breaking stuff for the sake of breaking stuff. I don't think breaking stuff and moving on quickly leaves us surrounded by carnage. I'm interested if things get broken as a consequence of actually creating something better.

中文：

我认为需要有基本的价值观和对我们在这其中所处位置的理解。并且要有一个清晰的目标感，那就是赋能和激励人们。我的意思是，帕特里克和我刚才还在谈论作为工具制造者的事情。我非常清楚并且非常自豪那是我的职业和我的实践。我喜欢尝试推动事物前进，这意味着创新。我有一个真正的问题——我认为人们把创新与与众不同或打破常规混为一谈。我对为了打破而打破毫无兴趣。我不认为打破常规然后迅速前进会让我们周围一片狼藉。我感兴趣的是，如果事物因为创造出更好的东西而被打破。

English:

But I think one of the things that is-- I think it's part of the human condition is that we assume that progress and innovation is sort of inevitable. And you know that it's not. You know that you have to have this underlying conviction, which is fuel. And then we need an idea and a vision. And then the resolve to make that vision something that is real, that is not just for us, but that we can share broadly.

中文：

但我认为其中一件事——我认为这是人类处境的一部分——就是我们想当然地认为进步和创新是某种必然。而你知道事实并非如此。你知道你必须拥有这种潜在的信念，这才是燃料。然后我们需要一个想法和一个愿景。然后是决心将这个愿景变成现实，不仅仅是为了我们自己，而是我们可以广泛分享的东西。

English:

You once used the phrase with me, sincerely elevate the species. Yeah, I think that-- I remember many times, and fortunately, I'm not talking in the past tense. But I do remember particular Sunday afternoons working. Actually, I remember working on some absurd details in terms of packaging. And in such a-- I mean, this compared to what you guys do, this will seem so trivial. But I had such a clear awareness that in designing a certain solution, for example, how we managed a cable that's in a box, that designing that, I knew that millions of people would engage with this little tab. And I can either make the cable an easy thing to unwrap. Sorry, that is such a trivial example, isn't it?

中文：

你曾经对我说过一句话：真诚地提升人类。是的，我想——我记得很多次，幸运的是，我不是在说过去时。但我确实记得一些特别的周日下午在工作。实际上，我记得在包装方面处理一些荒谬的细节。而且在这样一个——我的意思是，与你们所做的事情相比，这似乎微不足道。但我当时非常清楚地意识到，在设计某个解决方案时，例如，我们如何处理盒子里的电线，设计那个东西，我知道数百万计的人会接触到这个小标签。我可以让电线更容易解开。抱歉，这真是个微不足道的例子，不是吗？

English:

But clearly, you think that-- I mean, you can describe the purpose of that in seconds saved, that it shaves five seconds off the unwrapping of every cable and multiplied across hundreds of millions. But I get the sense from you that's not why you do it. It's not this trivial, utilitarian multiplication and calculation. There's something spiritual in it for you. What's the spiritual thing?

中文：

但显然，你认为——我的意思是，你可以用节省的时间来描述这样做的目的，每根电缆的拆包时间可以节省五秒钟，再乘以数亿根。但我从你身上感觉到，那不是你这样做的原因。这不是这种琐碎的、功利主义的乘法和计算。对你来说，这里面有一些精神层面的东西。什么是精神层面的东西？

English:

I think the spiritual thing is that I believe that when somebody unwrapped that box and took out that cable, and they thought, somebody gave a shit about me, I think that's a spiritual thing. And I think it's a way-- [APPLAUSE] And I know I'm in good company here. I know that when you know what used to depress me was this sense that solving a functional imperative, then we're done. But of course, that's not enough. That's not the characteristic of an evolved society, of an evolved species. And so that Sunday afternoon, when I really should have been out with my boys, and I'm worrying about this, I did feel a connection and an excitement that somebody was going to experience something that they don't even know exists yet. And even though it was a small thing, it really did come genuinely from a place of love and of care.

中文：

我认为精神层面的东西是，我相信当有人打开那个盒子，拿出那根电缆，他们会想，有人在乎我，我认为这是一种精神层面的东西。而且我认为这是一种方式——[掌声] 我知道我在这里有很多同道中人。我知道，过去让我沮丧的是那种感觉，即解决了功能上的必要性，然后我们就完成了。但当然，这还不够。那不是一个进化的社会、一个进化的物种的特征。所以那个周日下午，当我真的应该和我的孩子们在一起，而我却在担心这个的时候，我确实感觉到一种联系和兴奋，==有人将会体验到他们甚至还不知道存在的东西。即使那是一件小事，它也确实是发自内心的爱和关怀。==

English:

And Steve spoke about this. I mean, he spoke about it way more eloquently than I can. But he talked about when you make something with love and with care, even though the people that you've made it for, you don't know their story. They don't know your story. You'll never even shake their hands. But when they use the product that you've made, it's a way-- and the way Steve expressed it, I thought, was so beautiful. He said, it's a way of expressing our gratitude to the species. And I thought that was such an incredibly thoughtful and beautiful and authentic declaration.

中文：

==史蒂夫谈到过这一点。我的意思是，他比我讲得要雄辩得多。但他谈到，当你用爱和关怀制作某样东西时，即使你为之制作的人，你不知道他们的故事，他们也不知道你的故事，你甚至永远不会和他们握手。但是当他们使用你制作的产品时，这是一种方式——史蒂夫表达的方式，我认为，非常美。他说，这是我们向人类表达感激之情的一种方式。我认为那是一个非常深思熟虑、美丽而真诚的宣言。==

English:

So when people talk about your design, or design that occurred in your time in Apple, they often refer to minimalism, simplicity, the clarity and function, things like that. That's all certainly true. But part of what's very striking to me is how much of it seems to have some kind of sense of humor or joy woven into it. Like there is the iMac, like the Pixar lamp. There is the Lawson's iMacs in their Technicolor. There were even iPod socks. What's the role of joy in design?

中文：

所以当人们谈论你的设计，或者你在苹果公司时期的设计时，他们经常提到极简主义、简洁、清晰和功能等等。这些当然都是真的。但对我来说，非常引人注目的一部分是，其中似乎融入了某种幽默感或乐趣。比如iMac，就像皮克斯的台灯一样。还有色彩鲜艳的劳森iMac。甚至还有iPod袜子。乐趣在设计中扮演什么角色？

English:

Well, I think if-- that's such a good question, because I think one of the mistakes that people make is that they think simple products-- simplicity is about removing clutter. And to me, that means you just would end up with an uncluttered product. But a kind of desiccated solace product. Actually, that's a beautiful description-- desiccated solace product. I think that's what a lot of minimalism ends up being, or modernism ends up manifesting as. My goal and our goal collectively has been to bring order to chaos, to try and-- but simplicity to me is trying to succinctly express the essence of something and its purpose and its role in our life.

中文：

嗯，我想如果——这是一个很好的问题，因为我认为人们犯的一个错误是，他们认为简单的产品——简洁就是去除杂乱。对我来说，这意味着你最终只会得到一个整洁的产品。但那是一种干瘪的慰藉产品。实际上，这是一个很美的描述——干瘪的慰藉产品。我认为很多极简主义最终就是这样，或者现代主义最终表现为这样。我的目标和我们共同的目标一直是给混乱带来秩序，试图——但对我来说，简洁是试图简洁地表达事物的本质及其目的和在我们生活中的作用。

English:

I actually think that something that I feel conscious of is that I think generally in the valley and generally in our shared-- in our industry, I think joy and humor has been missing. And that's something that sort of weighed on me a bit. And the products that we're all developing, they're complicated, aren't they? And sometimes joy gets confused with being trivial. But I think-- I always go back-- I don't know about you-- but I always go back to being very clear that my state of mind and how I am in my practice ultimately is going to be embodied in the work. And so if I'm consumed with anxiety, that's how the work will end up. And so I think to be hopeful and optimistic and joyful in our practice and be that way in how we relate to each other and our colleagues, I actually think that's how the products will end up.

中文：

我实际上认为，我意识到的一点是，我认为通常在硅谷，以及在我们共同的——在我们的行业中，我认为快乐和幽默一直缺失。这一点在某种程度上困扰着我。我们都在开发的产品，它们很复杂，不是吗？有时快乐会被误认为是琐碎。但我认为——我总是回到——我不知道你怎么样——但我总是回到非常清楚的一点，那就是我的心态以及我在实践中的状态最终会体现在工作中。所以如果我被焦虑所吞噬，那么工作最终也会是那样的。所以我认为在我们的实践中保持希望、乐观和快乐，并在我们与彼此和同事相处时也保持这种状态，我实际上认为产品最终也会是那样的。

English:

There's a wonderful talk by a guy called Daniel Cook about how to build a princess-saving enterprise application. But he deconstructs Super Mario, and obviously, the core purpose is to save the princess, and approaches it from a standard enterprise application design standpoint and puts together some examples of how one might go about it. And he impunes this approach and critiques it, because he says that this kind of design fails to recognize that the user is a person. The person wants to learn. The person can change. The software has an effect on the person. And you have to take that very seriously. And the words you're using enable, inspire, love, care, gratitude, joy. To me, they seem to come from a conception of the person as somebody who's living and changing, and the software, in fact, has an effect on them.

中文：

有一个名叫丹尼尔·库克的人做过一个精彩的演讲，内容是如何构建一个拯救公主的企业级应用程序。但他解构了超级马里奥，显然，核心目的是拯救公主，并从标准企业级应用程序设计的角度来处理它，并举了一些例子说明如何实现。他抨击并批判了这种方法，因为他说这种设计未能认识到用户是一个人。人想要学习。人可以改变。软件对人有影响。你必须非常认真地对待这一点。而你使用的词语：赋能、激励、爱、关怀、感激、喜悦。对我来说，它们似乎源于这样一种观念：人是活生生的、不断变化的，而软件实际上对他们有影响。

English:

So something Patrick and I have talked about in the past is-- and this is something I'd love to try and describe. And you'll have to help me, because I think it's really important. And it's something that I realize, and it took me many years at Apple to realize this. But it's an effect that I believe occurs when you're in larger groups of people involved in the common cause of developing a product. I think one of the things that happens is generally we grow up wanting to be able to relate to people and wanting to be sociable. We find ourselves in a work environment with hopefully a diverse range of people. And one of the things that's interesting is if we are developing products together, there is this-- I noticed this, and it used to infuriate me before I came to try to have a slightly more generous interpretation of why this happens. But the people generally want to talk about product attributes that you can measure easily with a number.

中文：

所以帕特里克和我过去谈论过一些事情——这是我很想尝试描述的事情。你得帮我，因为我认为这非常重要。这是我意识到的事情，我在苹果公司花了很多年才意识到这一点。但我相信，当你在一个更大的群体中，为了开发一个产品的共同事业而努力时，会产生一种效应。我认为发生的一件事是，通常我们从小就希望能够与人交往，希望会社交。我们发现自己身处一个工作环境中，希望周围有各种各样的人。有趣的是，如果我们一起开发产品，就会出现这种情况——我注意到了这一点，在我试图对这种情况发生的原因做出稍微宽容一些的解释之前，它曾经让我非常愤怒。但是人们通常想谈论那些可以用数字轻松衡量的产品属性。

English:

So if you guys think about it and you think about what would dominate the conversations that you would have, product conversations, you'll end up talking about schedule, cost, speed, weight, anything where you can generally agree that six is a bigger number than two. And I understand why, but the problem is much of my contribution and the contribution of designers and other creatives, you can't measure easily with a number. Or it gets even more demeaning. It can be just, well, that's your opinion. Well, that's like telling your heart surgeon, well, that's your opinion, and you having a go yourself.

中文：

所以如果你们想一想，想一想在你们的产品讨论中，什么会主导对话，你们最终会谈论日程、成本、速度、重量，任何你们通常可以认同六大于二的事情。我理解为什么会这样，但问题是我的大部分贡献以及设计师和其他创意人员的贡献，你无法用数字轻易衡量。或者情况会变得更加贬低人。它可能仅仅是，嗯，那是你的看法。嗯，这就像告诉你的心脏外科医生，嗯，那是你的看法，然后你自己去尝试一样。

English:

And so what I came to realize-- and I think the more generous interpretation I had was we do that because we want to try to relate to each other. We do that because we want to be inclusive. But then this is the dangerous thing that happens. I would encourage-- I desperately hope this doesn't sound arrogant, but I would really encourage you to think about this, because I've been so struck by how important this is. The insidious lie follows, which is, we spend all our time talking about attributes because we can easily measure them. Therefore, this is all that matters. And that's a lie. It's important, but it's a partial truth.

中文：

所以我开始意识到——我认为我更宽容的解释是，我们这样做是因为我们想尝试与彼此建立联系。我们这样做是因为我们想具有包容性。但接下来发生的才是危险的事情。我鼓励——我非常希望这听起来不傲慢，但我真的鼓励你们思考这个问题，因为我深受其重要性的触动。==随之而来的是一个阴险的谎言，那就是，我们把所有时间都花在谈论属性上，因为我们可以轻松地衡量它们==。因此，这才是最重要的。这是一个谎言。它很重要，但只是部分事实。

English:

And all of the stuff that I think designers and other creatives can contribute to an experience or to a product that can make it delightful to use and joyful to use, as well as more productive. If it's delightful and joyful, things tend to be used more. Are equally important.

中文：

而所有我认为设计师和其他创意人员可以为体验或产品贡献的东西，那些能让产品使用起来令人愉悦、充满乐趣，并且更有效率的东西。如果它令人愉悦且充满乐趣，那么东西就更容易被使用。这些都同样重要。

English:

Nothing you say sounds arrogant, because when you have a beautiful British accent, then you get away with anything. So we're speaking about the import and the impact of design, but if we shift a little bit to the practice, is there a trade-off between speed of execution and ensuing quality?

中文：

你说的任何话听起来都不傲慢，因为当你拥有优美的英国口音时，你就可以逃脱任何指责。所以我们正在谈论设计的重要性和影响，但如果我们稍微转向实践，执行速度和随之而来的质量之间是否存在权衡？

English:

Sometimes. I was hoping you'd say no. I absolutely know there are fabulous examples where I would reframe the question as it being about motivation. So I think what tends to happen is when we're put in this situation of having to choose, I would get belligerent and say, no, we don't have to choose. We can do both. It's very hard-- I mean, I know you guys have heard this lots, but it's hard to do quality and speed and cost and other things. But I think there is a beauty to working efficiently, and I think we can say that's speed. I think we both pay a great deal of attention to the words that we use because they affect the way we think. And the words that we use to frame a problem are some of the most important. And so I would frame the issue of how can we work wonderfully efficiently to create something breast-taking quality?

中文：

有时会。我希望你会说不。我绝对知道有很多绝佳的例子，我会把这个问题重新定义为关于动机的问题。所以我认为通常情况下，当我们面临必须做出选择的情况时，我会变得好斗并说，不，我们不必选择。我们可以两者兼顾。这非常困难——我的意思是，我知道你们已经听过很多次了，但很难同时做到质量、速度、成本和其他事情。但我认为高效工作有一种美感，我想我们可以说那就是速度。我想我们都非常注意我们使用的词语，因为它们会影响我们的思维方式。而我们用来界定问题的词语是最重要的。所以我将这个问题定义为：我们如何才能高效地工作，创造出令人惊叹的品质？

English:

As organizations grow, there is another kind of tension where maybe for various people here in the audience-- certainly this is something I've experienced-- in the early days, it's-- the earliest days is just you. And then there's maybe a couple of other people, but you can kind of say a breath of everything that's happening, and you feel like you have the opportunity, at least, to exercise your taste or judgment or opinion and whatever the issue might be. And then perhaps things continue to scale, and at some point it becomes far beyond the scale and scope of any single human. And then there's this discontinuity where there are things that happen that I never saw. I never had the chance and opportunity to weigh in on. I don't know how I feel about it. I wouldn't have done that thing over there. How do you-- I mean, Apple was not a small company when you were there, certainly not in the later years. How do you deal with this? And I think it's both the scale and scope, but also doesn't it feel intrinsically unreasonable to simply say that this thing here doesn't accord with my taste?

中文：

随着组织的发展，会出现另一种紧张关系，也许对于在座的各位来说——当然这是我经历过的——在早期，也就是最初期，只有你一个人。然后可能还有其他几个人，但你基本上可以了解正在发生的一切，并且你觉得自己至少有机会在任何问题上运用你的品味、判断或意见。然后，也许事情继续扩大，到某个时候，它远远超出了任何单个人的规模和范围。然后就出现了这种不连续性，有些事情发生了，我从未见过。我从未有机会参与其中。我不知道对此有何感想。我不会做那边那件事。你是如何——我的意思是，你在苹果公司的时候，它并不是一家小公司，尤其是在后期。你是如何处理这个问题的？我认为这既是规模和范围的问题，但仅仅说这东西不符合我的品味，难道不觉得本质上不合理吗？

English:

I think it's very reasonable to say that. [LAUGHTER] It's very, very hard, isn't it? I think what I have-- I do believe that we go through chapters or seasons, and the painful part is the conclusion of one and the beginning of the next, where we have to adjust them. We change our approach. I think the one thing, obviously, it will not work to assume how we started is how we're going to finish. And so I think being very clear that we are in a constant state of flux, and it's trying to figure out, I believe, what is-- what I'm not going to compromise. And I think that's the very clear focus on your principles and your values and your motivations. I think the alarm bells always go off for me when I think, why did I do that has a motivation shifted? And that's when I've really been upset with myself and disappointed with myself and reset. But I do think if our motivations and values remain the same, we will find ways to be the control freaks we were born to be, which, of course-- I mean, all we can say, care as much as we-- but let's be honest.

中文：

我认为这样说非常合理。[笑声] 这非常非常困难，不是吗？我认为我所拥有的——我确实相信我们会经历不同的章节或季节，而痛苦的部分是一个章节的结束和下一个章节的开始，我们必须在其中进行调整。我们改变我们的方法。我认为有一点，很明显，假设我们如何开始就是我们如何结束是行不通的。所以我认为要非常清楚，我们处于不断变化的状态，并且我相信，要弄清楚什么是——我不会妥协的东西。我认为这就是非常明确地关注你的原则、你的价值观和你的动机。当我想，我为什么那样做，动机是否发生了变化时，警钟总是会响起。那是我真正对自己感到沮丧和失望并重新开始的时候。但我确实认为，如果我们的动机和价值观保持不变，我们就会找到方法成为我们天生的控制狂，当然——我的意思是，我们只能说，尽我们所能去关心——但老实说。

English:

For a design team that you're leading or participating in, what are the rituals?

中文：

对于你领导或参与的设计团队来说，有哪些仪式？

English:

Well, one of the-- I think that there's nothing more important to me than the creative team. And declaring that and being clear about, this is my contribution. And therefore, I need to be part of an extraordinary team. But that's just-- that's the price of admission, isn't it? So you can have the people, but practice our process, our practice, the protocols are so important. Over many years, I mean, I've been doing this and leading small creative teams for, I mean, over 30 years. These are some of the things that I've found important. If you're dealing, as I was describing earlier, with concepts that you can't measure with numbers, if you're dealing with ideas that always, if you think about the evolution of an idea, it always starts off as a thought and then a tentative discussion. One of the things I realize is just how these ethereal thoughts, these fragile concepts, are precarious. And I think a small team of people that really trust each other is, I think, is fundamentally important. Trust and love each other, who care about each other. If you care about-- then you might be in danger of actually listening.

中文：

嗯，其中之一——==我认为对我来说，没有什么比创意团队更重要了==。并且要声明这一点，并清楚地表明，这是我的贡献。因此，我需要成为一个非凡团队的一员。但这只是——这是入场券，不是吗？所以你可以拥有人才，但是实践我们的流程，我们的实践，这些协议都非常重要。多年来，我的意思是，我一直在做这件事，领导小型创意团队，我的意思是，超过30年了。这些是我发现的一些重要的事情。如果你正在处理，正如我之前描述的那样，无法用数字衡量的概念，如果你正在处理那些总是——如果你思考一个想法的演变，它总是从一个想法开始，然后是试探性的讨论。我意识到的一件事是，这些飘渺的想法，这些脆弱的概念是多么的不稳定。我认为一个小型的、真正互相信任的团队，我认为，是至关重要的。互相信任和爱护，关心彼此。如果你关心——那么你可能就有真正倾听的危险。

English:

The thing that just kills so many ideas-- and I've worked in places where this happens-- but people are just desperate to speak and to be heard. And there's nothing like-- you know what kills most ideas, I think, in people desperate to express an opinion. And it's really-- there's to be very clear opinions aren't ideas. I was going to say something really rude then, but I won't. But I think-- You can say it as we can cut it from the video. But the-- to be quiet and to listen. And one of the things that terrifies me, I know that I've missed really amazing ideas that came from a quiet place, from a quiet person. And that really scares me, because I don't know what I've missed.

中文：

扼杀如此多想法的事情——我曾在发生这种事情的地方工作过——就是人们只是拼命地想说话，想被倾听。没有什么比——你知道什么最能扼杀想法吗？我认为，是那些拼命想表达观点的人。而且真的——要非常清楚，观点不是想法。我当时想说一些非常粗鲁的话，但我不会。但我认为——你可以说出来，我们可以从视频中剪掉。但是——保持安静并倾听。让我感到恐惧的一件事是，我知道我错过了很多来自安静地方、来自安静的人的非常棒的想法。这真的让我害怕，因为我不知道我错过了什么。

English:

And so talking about the rituals, I think doing things that mean our relationship is authentic and deep. One of the things that I discovered that I think is really important-- we tried a lot of things at Apple. And most of the things that I tried didn't work out. But a few things I was excited about and grew, I think, to be very powerful. I think one, as a practice, is very good to make things for each other. I think for that to become part of your daily way of connecting to your team, to think about what you can make for each other, that's just really-- it puts you in a lovely place. It makes you more worried about them than you. It makes you vulnerable. And it makes them grateful. And that's a lot, isn't it? I mean, just think about what I said. That starts to define quite a lovely culture.

中文：

所以谈到仪式，我认为做一些能让我们的关系真实而深刻的事情。我发现的一件我认为非常重要的事情——我们在苹果尝试了很多事情。我尝试的大部分事情都没有成功。但有一些事情让我很兴奋，并且我认为它们发展得非常强大。我认为其中之一，作为一种实践，就是为彼此制作东西，这非常好。我认为让这成为你与团队日常联系的一部分，思考你能为彼此做些什么，这真的——它让你处于一个美好的境地。它让你更担心他们而不是你自己。它让你变得脆弱。它让他们心存感激。这已经很多了，不是吗？我的意思是，想想我刚才说的话。这开始定义一种相当可爱的文化。

English:

And then connected to that, something I was really struck by-- ==Paul Graham says, make things people want. And Johnny Ives says, make things for each other==. Yes. I mean, that's what we do, isn't it? I mean, all we're doing is at a very personal level practicing what we're doing at our professional level. All of us here, I guess, almost every single person here, we're about making something for other people. And so perhaps-- I don't know quite what-- Making people want, I feel, is sort of a business strategy. Whereas something what you're saying is make things for each other is a team strategy.

中文：

然后与此相关的是，有一件事让我印象深刻——保罗·格雷厄姆说，制造人们想要的东西。而约翰尼·艾维斯说，为彼此制造东西。是的。我的意思是，那就是我们所做的，不是吗？我的意思是，我们所做的一切都是在非常个人化的层面上实践我们在专业层面所做的事情。我想，在座的几乎每一个人，我们都是在为别人制造东西。所以也许——我不太清楚——制造人们想要的东西，我觉得，更像是一种商业策略。而你所说的为彼此制造东西则是一种团队策略。

English:

Well, as a team-- well, so for example, one of the things I thought was great was that you-- every Friday morning, I asked that one person on the design team would make breakfast for the whole team. And we took it in turns. And we-- So make things for each other. I'm imagining prototype iPhones. But no, it can also be bacon and eggs. I'm talking cornflakes and milk. I mean, we saw, I mean, dizzy heights of some of the food. And some of it was so shocking. But it all came from the same place in terms of motivation.

中文：

嗯，作为一个团队——嗯，举个例子，我认为很棒的一件事是，你们——每个星期五早上，我都会要求设计团队中的一个人为整个团队做早餐。我们轮流来。我们——所以要为彼此做事。我想象的是iPhone原型机。但不，它也可以是培根和鸡蛋。我说的是玉米片和牛奶。我的意思是，我们看到过，我的意思是，一些食物达到了令人眩晕的高度。有些食物则令人震惊。但从动机上来说，它们都源于同一个地方。

English:

And something that was connected that I was surprised at how powerful it was-- excuse me-- was we would host-- we would take it in turns to have the design team come to our homes. And we would spend a day working in our home. And this is something I probably thought way too much about. But it was in a very, very powerful way of one doing-- or encouraging us in our practice to do good work. And in building the team. And I think there's an interesting-- first of all, there's an interesting dynamic in terms of how we regard each other. The host-- and this is a bit like when we make something for one another. The host is slightly anxious and concerned about the potential judgment of their soft furnishings. And I mean, you know what it's like when you have somebody come to your house. There is a self-consciousness. And well, certainly, an awkwardness, I feel, and then anxiety. And I don't think that's unhealthy always.

中文：

还有一件相关的事情，我很惊讶它如此强大——抱歉——那就是我们会轮流邀请设计团队到我们家里来。我们会在家里工作一天。这件事我可能想得太多了。但它以一种非常非常强大的方式，一方面促使——或者说鼓励我们在实践中做好工作。另一方面也在建设团队。我认为这里有一个有趣的——首先，在我们如何看待彼此方面，存在一种有趣的动态。主人——这有点像我们为彼此做某事的时候。主人会稍微焦虑和担心他们柔软的家具可能会受到评判。我的意思是，你知道当有人来你家时是什么感觉。会有一种自我意识。嗯，当然，我觉得会有些尴尬，然后是焦虑。我不认为这总是不健康的。

English:

And then the guests who you are hosting they're on better behavior than if they were all just trundling into a conference room. And then you've got the context. If you're designing for people, who here would actually want to spend time in a conference room? I can't think of a more soulless and depressing place. I mean, I always think it's funny. Think about the relationship between the chair you're sat on and how you feel. Like, you would-- none of you would sit watching the TV on these chairs. I mean, you wouldn't choose to sit on this chair unless it was to listen to John and Patrick. I'm not sure that we're the attraction in this particular event.

中文：

然后你接待的客人，他们的行为会比他们都挤进会议室时更好。然后你就有了情境。如果你是为人们设计的，这里有谁真的想在会议室里待着？我想不出比这更没有灵魂、更令人沮丧的地方了。我的意思是，我总觉得这很有趣。想想你坐的椅子和你感觉之间的关系。比如，你们——你们没有人会坐在这些椅子上看电视。我的意思是，除非是为了听约翰和帕特里克的演讲，否则你不会选择坐在这把椅子上。我不确定我们是这次活动的吸引力所在。

English:

But I think there is an important point, which is if you're designing for people and you're in someone's living room, sat on their sofa or sat on their floor, and your sketchbook is on their coffee table, of course you think differently, don't you? Of course, your preoccupation. Where your mind wanders is so different than if you're sat in a typical corporate conference room.

中文：

但我认为有一个重要的观点，那就是如果你是为人们设计的，并且你身处某人的客厅，坐在他们的沙发上或地板上，你的速写本放在他们的咖啡桌上，你当然会思考得不一样，不是吗？当然，你所关注的事情。你的思绪游荡的地方与你坐在典型的公司会议室里是如此不同。

English:

Is beauty subjective or objective? I think we now get to the easier questions. Yeah. I think it's-- I don't-- I mean, I'd be interested on your take on that. I think it's a bit of both. I think utility and function, if something doesn't work, it's ugly. I've always get frustrated when people try to-- they set up a false opposition between utility and aesthetics. And when I've designed something or been involved in the design of something that doesn't work, I don't care what it looks like. It's ugly. I think the tougher thing is when we get onto the issues of taste. And I think design has always been a difficult thing in that because it's very easy for everybody to have an opinion, everybody does, it just doesn't mean every opinion has the same weight. And I think that's a relatively robust statement in that if you've studied and studied and studied design-- although I know people who've studied and studied design with terrible taste. So I don't know. Yeah, it's a very-- it's a good question.

中文：

美是主观的还是客观的？我想我们现在可以讨论一些更简单的问题了。是的。我认为——我不——我的意思是，我很想听听你对此的看法。我认为两者兼而有之。我认为实用性和功能性，如果某样东西不起作用，它就是丑陋的。当人们试图在实用性和美学之间建立一种错误的对立时，我总是感到沮丧。当我设计或参与设计某样不起作用的东西时，我不在乎它看起来怎么样。它就是丑陋的。我认为更困难的是当我们涉及到品味问题时。我认为设计一直是一件困难的事情，因为每个人都很容易有自己的看法，每个人都有，但这并不意味着每个看法都具有相同的分量。我认为这是一个相对有力的陈述，因为如果你学习、学习再学习设计——尽管我知道有些人学习了设计，但品味却很糟糕。所以我不知道。是的，这是一个非常——这是一个很好的问题。

English:

OK, so Christopher Alexander said that between two objects or two choices or two paths, the one that feels more humane is the one that you should choose. But that this kind of sense of humanity in the object is a better guide than beauty, which perhaps pulls you into more subjective territory. Does that resonate at all, or do you think that sounds crazy?

中文：

好的，克里斯托弗·亚历山大说过，在两个物体、两个选择或两条路径之间，感觉更人性化的那个是你应该选择的。但是物体中的这种人性感觉比美更能指导你，而美可能会把你拉入更主观的领域。这有共鸣吗，或者你觉得这听起来很疯狂？

English:

No, I think that's absolutely the case. And I think that people-- I think generally most companies patronize consumers. I think users are-- I actually do believe-- are very sophisticated. And I think there's issues of beauty, of humanity. I also think-- and this goes back to the first thing I was saying about my sense of Steve and the Apple team looking at the first Mac-- that you sense care. And I've tried to talk about this before. I really do believe-- and I wish that I had empirical evidence. But I do believe that we have this ability to sense care. It's easy in a service because you confront care, because you confront the person. When it's vicarious, when it's via an object, when it's via a piece of software, it's more complex. But I think you might understand it more if I said, you sense carelessness. You know carelessness. And so I think it's reasonable to believe that you also know care and you sense care.

中文：

不，我认为绝对是这样。而且我认为人们——我认为通常大多数公司都轻视消费者。我认为用户——我确实相信——非常成熟。我认为存在美的问题，人性的问题。我还认为——这又回到了我最初说的，我对史蒂夫和苹果团队看待第一台Mac的感觉——你感受到了关怀。我以前也尝试谈论过这个问题。我真的相信——我希望我有经验证据。但我确实相信我们有这种感知关怀的能力。在服务中这很容易，因为你直接面对关怀，因为你直接面对人。当它是间接的，当它是通过一个物体，当它是通过一个软件时，情况就更复杂了。但我想如果我说，你感觉到了粗心大意，你可能会更容易理解。你知道粗心大意。所以我认为有理由相信你也知道关怀，并且能感觉到关怀。

English:

And we worked very hard and I felt passionately about finishing the inside of products. And when I mean finishing, I mean we designed everything. And we cared about everything. And I mean, I'm sure many of you have heard a bit about a great cabinetmaker finishes the back of a drawer, even though it's unlikely it will be seen. But in the same way, I think a mark of how evolved we are as people, it's what we do when no one sees. And I think that's indicative. It's a powerful marker of who we truly are. And I would be haunted by-- if all we did was the outside, I would have this nagging feeling in my tummy that we were just being superficial. [APPLAUSE]

中文：

我们非常努力地工作，我对完成产品的内部设计充满热情。当我说完成时，我的意思是我们设计了一切。我们关心一切。我的意思是，我相信你们很多人都听说过，一个伟大的橱柜制造商会完成抽屉的背面，即使它不太可能被看到。但同样地，我认为衡量我们作为人进化程度的一个标志，就是我们在没人看见的时候所做的事情。我认为这具有指示意义。这是我们真实身份的一个有力标志。如果我只做表面功夫，我会感到不安——我的肚子里会有一种挥之不去的感觉，觉得我们只是肤浅的。[掌声]

English:

So you mentioned modernism a little bit earlier in this discussion. And there's a puzzle that I've been trying to reconcile around modernism that maybe you can help me with, where so much early modernism was kind of deliberately ugly. Like you've the Duchamp fountain and you have-- I mean, even Picasso's work, I mean, it's dissonant, right? It's certainly not classically beautiful. And then you sort of had this political valence to the program. And Gropius said that Bauhaus was a-- he said in the manifesto that it was a socialist movement. And you were originally trained in Bauhaus design, right? Yes. Yeah. So is this kind of-- and you've Schoenberg and the atonality and all this stuff, right? But then the Apple products and the products that you designed are very beautiful. And Apple is not a socialist undertaking. And so what's going on here? And the particular thing I'm trying to figure out is was there a strain to modernism where it was intentionally trying to be dissonant or even uglier to shock people or something? And how maybe now with some remove, you're no longer at Apple, how do you view that whole thing? And what's your take on modernism?

中文：

所以你之前在讨论中提到了一点现代主义。关于现代主义，我一直试图理解一个难题，也许你能帮我一下，那就是很多早期现代主义作品似乎是故意丑陋的。比如杜尚的喷泉，还有——我的意思是，即使是毕加索的作品，我的意思是，它是不和谐的，对吧？它肯定不是古典意义上的美。然后这个项目又带有一些政治色彩。格罗皮乌斯说包豪斯是——他在宣言中说它是一场社会主义运动。而你最初接受的是包豪斯设计训练，对吧？是的。嗯。所以这是——你还有勋伯格和无调性音乐之类的东西，对吧？但是苹果的产品和你设计的产品都非常漂亮。而苹果并不是一个社会主义企业。那么这里发生了什么？我特别想弄清楚的是，现代主义中是否存在一种倾向，即故意制造不和谐甚至更丑陋的东西来震惊人们或达到某种目的？现在你已经离开苹果一段时间了，你如何看待这一切？你对现代主义的看法是什么？

English:

That's a great question. I think what tends to happen is very often at the beginning of a movement, whether it's a design or an art movement, there is that incredible energetic-- I mean, in a way, by definition, if it marks the beginning of a movement, there is energy. And I think often beauty is-- it evolves. Beauty takes time. And very often at the beginning of an energy, it's an explosion. And there's not time-- I would dare presume that certainly if we're talking about fine art, that people would say they have no time, they don't want to be distracted by concepts of beauty. And so I think for sure, if a lot of modernism was driven by the heady excitement about new materials, your obsession was the manipulation of that new material.

中文：

这是一个很好的问题。我认为通常情况下，在一个运动的开端，无论是设计运动还是艺术运动，都会有一种令人难以置信的活力——我的意思是，从某种意义上说，根据定义，如果它标志着一个运动的开始，那么就存在能量。而且我认为美通常是——它会进化。美需要时间。而且通常在一个能量的开端，它是一场爆炸。而且没有时间——我敢冒昧地推测，当然，如果我们谈论的是美术，人们会说他们没有时间，他们不想被美的概念分心。所以我确信，如果很多现代主义是由对新材料的兴奋所驱动的，那么你的痴迷就是对那种新材料的操纵。

English:

One thing-- I mean, I'm not sure how many of you guys know about Bauhaus, but this was a movement in Germany. But what you will know, you'll be-- and it ranged from fine art to furniture to architecture. Patrick mentioned Walter Gropius and incredible movement. But what you would probably be most familiar with would be chairs, like the Breuer Chair or the Vassili Chair, which were-- if you think of-- try and think of like polysteel, chrome-plated tubes that are bent, those sort of bent chairs. So what's interesting there is these guys had just figured they were so excited because they'd figured out how to bend tubes. And so what did they do? They bent tubes. And that's why all the furniture is bent tube furniture. So I think that-- I mean, that's what I would have done. If I'd figured-- because when you bend tubes, they tend to kink. And so they'd figured out this way, putting springs into tubes. And so of course, you'd run away and you'd bend as many tubes as you could get your hands on. Beauty probably wasn't at the front of your mind. Tubes.

中文：

有一件事——我的意思是，我不确定你们中有多少人了解包豪斯，但这是德国的一场运动。但你们会知道的，你们会——它涵盖了从美术到家具再到建筑。帕特里克提到了沃尔特·格罗皮乌斯和那场令人难以置信的运动。但你们可能最熟悉的是椅子，比如布鲁尔椅或瓦西里椅，它们是——如果你想想——试着想想比如聚酯钢，弯曲的镀铬管子，那种弯曲的椅子。所以有趣的是，这些人刚刚弄明白，他们非常兴奋，因为他们弄明白了如何弯曲管子。所以他们做了什么？他们弯曲了管子。这就是为什么所有的家具都是弯管家具。所以我认为——我的意思是，如果是我，我也会那样做。如果我弄明白了——因为当你弯曲管子时，它们往往会扭结。所以他们想出了这个办法，把弹簧放进管子里。所以当然，你会跑掉，然后尽可能多地弯曲你能弄到的管子。美可能不是你首先考虑的事情。管子。

English:

So when I look at your work and we haven't yet talked about love from, although maybe if you want to give people a short summary of how you think about that, that might be helpful. But when I look at your more recent work and some of what love from has done, I see it as Johnny's ornament era, where Apple was so stripped down and bare and reduced to the essence. And now I see that-- I mean, maybe this is a misapprehension. But now you're more curious to try other styles. Is that true?

中文：

所以当我看到你的作品时，我们还没有谈到LoveFrom，虽然也许如果你想给大家简要介绍一下你对它的看法，那可能会有所帮助。但是当我看到你最近的作品以及LoveFrom所做的一些事情时，我将其视为约翰尼的装饰时代，而苹果公司则非常精简、朴素，并简化到本质。现在我看到——我的意思是，也许这是一种误解。但是现在你更渴望尝试其他风格。这是真的吗？

English:

I think it's a lovely observation. I think-- so it's nearly six years ago that I left Apple. And my goal was to build the most extraordinary creative team I possibly could. And we're about 50, 60 people, many of the designers I've worked with for decades and decades, which means I've worked with them at Apple. And-- but it's a very diverse team. So it's a team of industrial designers, graphic designers, user interface designers, architects, typographers, musicians, sound designers. And I think perhaps what you're referring to is that just the-- our usefulness or the people that we're collaborating with, that's a very diverse group now. Where before we were very focused and we had a clear criteria for what we were doing. But if you're working for the king on his coronation identity, that, of course, would demand a very different approach than the one we would have taken if we were designing instructional products for how to use an iMac. So I think that's-- It follows the context. I think it's really what the problem is that we're addressing.

中文：

我认为这是一个可爱的观察。我想——所以差不多六年前我离开了苹果公司。我的目标是建立一个我所能建立的最非凡的创意团队。我们大约有五六十人，其中许多设计师我已经和他们共事了几十年，这意味着我在苹果公司和他们共事过。而且——但这是一个非常多元化的团队。所以这是一个由工业设计师、平面设计师、用户界面设计师、建筑师、排版师、音乐家、音效设计师组成的团队。我想也许你指的是——只是我们的用处或者我们合作的人，现在是一个非常多元化的群体。而以前我们非常专注，并且对我们正在做的事情有明确的标准。但是如果你正在为国王设计他的加冕典礼标识，那当然需要一种与我们设计iMac使用说明产品时截然不同的方法。所以我认为那是——它取决于具体情况。我认为这实际上取决于我们正在解决的问题。

English:

So you're talking a lot about the purpose of design and the effect the design has on the recipient, on the user, on the consumer, whatever the case is. There is widespread concern and speculation about the effects of smartphones slash the internet. It doesn't necessarily accord just with the smartphone. But on some of these products on attention spans, and whether it has some adverse effect on kids or teens or who knows, maybe all of us, maybe the adults as well. There are questions over with AI, whether it changes how education works and cheating and school. So all of these technologies that we create have this potential double-sidedness to them. And so I guess as somebody who clearly takes seriously and thinks seriously about the full effects, how do you think about the possible harms?

中文：

所以你谈论了很多关于设计的目的以及设计对接受者、用户、消费者（无论情况如何）的影响。人们普遍关注和猜测智能手机/互联网的影响。这不一定仅仅与智能手机有关。但是关于这些产品对注意力持续时间的影响，以及它是否对儿童、青少年，或者谁知道呢，也许对我们所有人，也许对成年人也有一些不利影响。关于人工智能，人们也存在疑问，它是否会改变教育的运作方式、学校作弊等问题。所以我们创造的所有这些技术都具有潜在的双面性。所以我猜，作为一个显然认真对待并认真思考全面影响的人，你如何看待可能的危害？

English:

Yeah, I think when-- And this is-- There's probably not anything that I can be more preoccupied or bothered by than what you just described. I think when you're innovating, of course, there will be unintended consequences. You hope that the majority will be pleasant surprises, certain products that I've been very, very involved with. I think there were some unintended consequences that were far from pleasant. My issue is that even though there was no intention, I think there still needs to be responsibility. And that weighs on me, as you know, heavily.

中文：

是的，我想当——这是——可能没有什么比你刚才描述的更能让我全神贯注或困扰的了。我认为当你创新的时候，当然，会有意想不到的后果。你希望大多数会是惊喜，某些我曾经非常非常投入的产品。我认为有一些意想不到的后果远非令人愉快。我的问题是，即使没有意图，我认为仍然需要承担责任。正如你所知，这沉重地压在我心头。

English:

What I think has been particularly difficult is traditionally when you look at innovation, there's nothing new with-- I mean, if you-- one thing, I mean, Patrick and I were months ago talking about some of the architecture that was associated with the Industrial Revolution in England. And there are examples-- God, we could talk about this. Google Victorian pumping stations. So a pumping-- so you imagine this idea that sewage used to flow freely down the streets. And then suddenly-- and this is for all of humanity's existence, if there were streets. And then suddenly sewage was silently and predictably and consistently kept from streets. And the machines that achieved this were housed in cathedral-like structures. I mean, it's amazing.

中文：

我认为特别困难的是，传统上当你审视创新时，并没有什么新鲜事——我的意思是，如果你——有一件事，我的意思是，帕特里克和我几个月前谈论过一些与英国工业革命相关的建筑。有一些例子——天哪，我们可以谈论这个。谷歌一下维多利亚时代的泵站。所以一个泵站——所以你想象一下，过去污水曾经自由地流淌在街道上。然后突然——这是在整个人类历史上，如果存在街道的话。然后突然之间，污水被悄无声息地、可预测地、持续地隔离在街道之外。而实现这一目标的机器则被安置在像大教堂一样的建筑中。我的意思是，这太神奇了。

English:

And there is just an incredible precedent for these huge-- when you have a big technological change, it impacts society. And the Industrial Revolution is, my goodness, a profound, profoundly significant occurrence in the sort of middle of the 1800s, certainly in the UK. The thing that I think is so challenging is there was time for society to stop and consider what was happening. And there was time for structure-- and whether that was sort of infrastructure, whether it was sort of social frameworks-- to try and assimilate and deal with these shifts. And I think what's been very challenging is we are moving so fast. The discussion comes far too late.

对于这些巨大的——当你经历重大的技术变革时，它会影响社会，这简直是一个令人难以置信的先例。工业革命，我的天哪，是19世纪中期，尤其是在英国，一个深刻的、意义深远的事件。我认为如此具有挑战性的是，当时社会有时间停下来思考正在发生的事情。并且有时间建立结构——无论是基础设施，还是社会框架——来尝试吸收和应对这些转变。而我认为一直以来都非常具有挑战性的是我们发展得太快了。讨论来得太晚了。

English:

And there can't be-- I mean, unless there is-- I mean, the thing that I find encouraging about AI is it's very rare for there to be a discussion about AI and there not to be the appropriate concerns about safety. What I was far more worried about was for years and years and years, there will be discussions about social media. And I was extremely concerned about social media. And there was no discussion whatsoever. And it's the insidious challenge of a problem that's not even talked about. I think he's always more concerning. And so, yeah, I think the rates of changes they address, I think even if you're innocent in your intention, I think if you're involved in something that has poor consequences, you need to own it. And that ownership personally has driven a lot of what I've been working on that I can't talk about at the moment, but look forward to being able to talk about at some point in the future. [APPLAUSE]

中文：

而且不可能——我的意思是，除非有——我的意思是，关于人工智能，我发现令人鼓舞的一点是，很少有关于人工智能的讨论而不涉及对安全性的适当担忧。我更担心的是，多年以来，一直会有关于社交媒体的讨论。我对社交媒体非常担忧。但根本没有任何讨论。这是一个甚至没有被谈论的问题所带来的阴险挑战。我认为他总是更令人担忧。所以，是的，我认为他们所解决的变化速度，我认为即使你的意图是无辜的，我认为如果你参与了会产生不良后果的事情，你就需要承担责任。而这种责任感个人驱动了我目前正在做的很多工作，我现在还不能谈论，但期待将来某个时候能够谈论。[掌声]

English:

You mentioned-- I wasn't going to bring it up, but you mentioned the Victorian pump dictation. [LAUGHTER] Which place and time in history had the best design?

中文：

你提到了——我本来不打算提的，但你提到了维多利亚时代的泵站听写。[笑声] 历史上哪个地方和哪个时代的设计最好？

English:

Oh, that's such a good question. I wouldn't dare to answer, but I do think that the-- I think what happened in the Industrial Revolution, I'm just absolutely obsessed with at the moment. You know, there was a team at Love From we've been doing. We've been doing research. I'm lucky enough to work with this amazing writer called Jemima, who I think might be here this afternoon. She's been doing a bunch of research on whether it's physical objects or social consequences. Because I see design as much more than objects, I think, for example, there were two companies in England that really were born out of-- they were Quakers. There was one called Cabris, and the other was a company called Fries. Both Birmingham, right? I think they were. I think in the Midlands.

中文：

哦，这真是个好问题。我不敢回答，但我确实认为——我认为工业革命时期发生的事情，我现在完全着迷于此。你知道，Love From 有一个团队一直在做这件事。我们一直在做研究。我很幸运能和一位名叫杰迈玛的了不起的作家合作，我想她今天下午可能也在这里。她一直在做大量研究，无论是关于物质实体还是社会后果。因为我认为设计远不止于物体，例如，英国有两家公司，它们真正诞生于——它们是贵格会教徒。一家叫Cabris，另一家叫Fries。都在伯明翰，对吧？我想是的。我想在米德兰兹。

English:

But what was so interesting was the people that ran these companies, they also designed the housing. And you don't just design a place to put bedrooms. Housing, which meant towns, which meant this sense of civic responsibility. And of course, that was appropriate, because people were moving. The Industrial Revolution was not just a mass manufacture for the first time in history, but it was this huge movement from the land to cities, which had never happened before. And so I just think that generally when we talk about these huge shifts, of course, we all get nervous and worried. But there are wonderfully encouraging prototypes that we can look to. And there was-- so just after Cabris and Fries, they were first. There was Hershey's in Philadelphia, I think, and a very similar approach and concern. I know less about that specific example. But so I love it when the innovation is cultural, is political. Very often it's spiritual, and it's manifest in buildings.

中文：

但非常有趣的是，经营这些公司的人，他们也设计了住房。你不仅仅是设计一个放卧室的地方。住房，意味着城镇，意味着这种公民责任感。当然，这是恰当的，因为人们在迁移。工业革命不仅仅是历史上第一次大规模生产，更是一场从农村到城市的巨大迁徙，这在以前从未发生过。所以我只是认为，通常当我们谈论这些巨大的转变时，当然，我们都会感到紧张和担忧。但是有一些非常鼓舞人心的原型可供我们借鉴。当时——就在Cabris和Fries之后，他们是第一批。我想，费城的好时公司也采取了非常相似的方法和关注点。我对那个具体的例子了解较少。所以我喜欢当创新是文化的、政治的时候。很多时候它也是精神上的，并且体现在建筑中。

English:

You speak in public now very rarely, and so of course, very grateful that you're here. We're at a programmable financial infrastructure conference. How and why should people-- I mean, of course, the businesses here are from every crevice and aspect and different sector of the economy. But for people in the infrastructure domain or for businesses like Stripe-- and maybe Stripe is kind of an example, or can stand in for other businesses where ostensibly, perhaps, one ought not care intensely about design in the way that perhaps a consumer electronics company ought to-- why should a business with the characteristics that Stripe has care so much?

中文：

你现在很少在公开场合演讲，所以当然，非常感谢你来到这里。我们现在在一个可编程金融基础设施会议上。人们应该如何以及为什么——我的意思是，当然，这里的企业来自经济的各个角落、各个方面和不同领域。但是对于基础设施领域的人们或像Stripe这样的企业——也许Stripe算是一个例子，或者可以代表其他表面上可能不像消费电子公司那样应该如此关注设计的企业——为什么像Stripe这样具有这些特征的企业应该如此关心设计呢？

English:

Well, if Stripe didn't, Stripe wouldn't be Stripe, and you wouldn't be sat here. So every bone in my body, I truly believe that if we want to participate as members of the species, we actually don't think we have a choice. I think it's an obligation and a responsibility to care for each other. And I mean, Freud said a great thing. Freud said, all there is is love and work. Work and love, that's all there is. And so we spend a lot of time working. And so if we elect to spend our time working, not caring about other people, I think not only do other people suffer, I think we suffer. I think that's a corrosive existence. And so I think it's-- I would see it as not only a responsibility, but truly a privilege if we get to practice and express our concern and our care for one another.

中文：

嗯，如果Stripe不这样做，Stripe就不会是Stripe，你也不会坐在这里。所以我骨子里的每一寸都坚信，如果我们想作为人类的一员参与其中，我们实际上认为我们别无选择。我认为关心彼此是一种义务和责任。我的意思是，弗洛伊德说过一句很棒的话。弗洛伊德说，世间万物唯有爱与工作。工作与爱，仅此而已。所以我们花了很多时间工作。因此，如果我们选择花时间工作，而不关心他人，我认为不仅他人会受苦，我们自己也会受苦。我认为那是一种腐蚀性的存在。所以我认为——我不仅将其视为一种责任，更将其视为一种真正的荣幸，如果我们能够实践并表达我们对彼此的关心和关爱。

English:

Yeah, I don't see it as-- I don't carve my existence up in that way of thinking, this is with my commercial hat on. I'm just Johnny.

中文：

是的，我不这么认为——我不会用那种方式来划分我的存在，认为这是戴着我的商业帽子。我只是约翰尼。

English:

On that note, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you very much. [APPLAUSE] Thank you.

中文：

就此，非常感谢你加入我们。非常感谢。[掌声] 谢谢。
