00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:11,520
As you know, I wrote a memo called "See Change" in December of '22.
如您所知，我在 22 年 12 月写了一份名为“See Change”的备忘录。

00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,820
And it has really been central to all of our activities since then,
从那时起，它确实成为我们所有活动的核心，

00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,080
because interest rates are so central in everything we do.
因为利率在我们所做的一切中都是如此重要。

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,040
And I've been thinking lately that interest rates are kind of like the weather.
我最近一直在想，利率有点像天气。

00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,520
The weather determines what we'll wear, where we'll go,
天气决定了我们要穿什么，要去哪里，

00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,600
what activities we can conduct, whether we stay indoors or outdoors.
 我们可以进行哪些活动，无论我们呆在室内还是室外。

00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,760
It dominates our life in a kind of unspoken and unrecognized way.
它以一种不言而喻和不被认可的方式主宰着我们的生活。

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,880
Similarly,
同样地

00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,440
interest rates are the climate of investing in finance and business and the economy.
利率是投资金融和商业以及经济的环境。

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,320
And they determine or influence everything that goes on in a material way.
它们决定或影响以物质方式发生的一切。

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,960
And when they change significantly,
当它们发生重大变化时，

00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,630
the environment for activity changes and consequently,
活动环境发生变化，因此，

00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,720
all the activities change.
所有活动都发生了变化。

00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:11,280
And I followed up "See Change" December of '22 with a memo called "Bird Thoughts on See Change" May of '23.
我在 22 年 12 月的“See Change”之后，又写了一份名为 “Bird Thoughts on See Change” 的备忘录，23 年 5 月。

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,880
But I said in there that largely thanks to highly accommodative monetary policy,
但我在那篇文章中说，这在很大程度上要归功于高度宽松的货币政策，

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,350
we went through unusually easy times in a number of important regards over a prolonged period of time,
在很长一段时间内，我们在许多重要方面经历了异常轻松的时期，

00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,280
but that's over.
但这已经结束了。

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,160
I said in the "See Change" memo that in 1980,
我在“See Change”备忘录中说，在 1980 年，

00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,560
I had a personal loan outstanding from a bank.
我从一家银行获得了一笔未偿还的个人贷款。

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,200
And I got a slip in the mail that said,
我收到了一张邮件单，上面写着：

00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,160
the rate on your loan is now 22 and a quarter.
您的贷款利率现在是 22 又 1/5。

00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,800
40 years later, I was able to borrow, again personally,
40 年后，我再次以个人身份借款，

00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,640
at 2 and a quarter fixed for 15 years.
2 又 1/2 固定 15 年。

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,360
Now, hopefully, I was an improving creditor over that period of time.
现在，希望我在那段时间里是一个进步的债权人。

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,240
But you can see from this chart that the Fed funds rate did the same thing.
但从这张图表中可以看出，联邦基金利率也起到了同样的作用。

00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:56,430
It went from 20 in 1980 to zero for much of the last 15 years, again,
它从 1980 年的 20 次下降到过去 15 年的大部分时间里的零，再次，

00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,720
a decline of 2,000 basis points.
下跌 2,000 个基点。

00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,380
And I believe that that 2,000
我相信那 2,000

00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:07,440
basis point decline was the most important single event in the financial and business world in the last half century.
基点下跌是过去半个世纪金融和商业界最重要的单一事件。

00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,080
Declining interest rates have very significant effects.
利率下降具有非常显着的影响。

00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,240
They stimulate the economy.
它们刺激经济。

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,280
They increase consumer demand.
它们增加了消费者需求。

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,760
They make most businesses more profitable.
它们使大多数企业更有利可图。

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,240
They make assets more valuable.
它们使资产更有价值。

00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,360
They reduce the cost of capital and make financing more readily accessible and,
它们降低了资本成本，使融资更容易获得，并且

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,560
of course, cheaper.
当然更便宜。

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,560
And they make default and bankruptcy less likely.
它们降低了违约和破产的可能性。

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,960
I have compared the declining interest rates of this period to a moving walkway.
我把这一时期不断下降的利率比作一条自动人行道。

00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,320
And you get on and you walk at your normal pace.
然后你继续前进，以正常的速度行走。

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,640
You make terrific progress.
你取得了巨大的进步。

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,880
And you say, boy, I'm really fit.
你说，孩子，我真的很健康。

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,440
Similarly, people buy assets.
同样，人们购买资产。

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,560
Maybe they buy them with borrowed money.
也许他们用借来的钱买了它们。

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,040
They get great net results.
他们得到了很好的净结果。

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,080
And they say, boy, I'm smart.
他们说，天哪，我很聪明。

00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,560
But in both cases, we have a lot of help.
但在这两种情况下，我们都有很多帮助。

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,580
And the declining interest rates were a moving walkway, a tailwind,
而利率下降是一条移动的走道，是一股顺风，

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,440
if you will, behind investors for a long period of time.
如果你愿意的话，在很长一段时间内支持投资者。

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,070
Now,
现在

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,880
easy money describes some of the problematic side effects of low rates.
Easy Money 描述了低利率的一些有问题的副作用。

00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,560
And they're worth noting, too.
他们也值得注意。

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,200
They reduce the perceived opportunity cost.
它们降低了感知的机会成本。

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,520
You don't have to give up much to borrow money or to make an investment.
您不必放弃太多来借钱或进行投资。

00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,720
And so they lower the bar.
因此，他们降低了标准。

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,120
They encourage risk taking because the returns on safe investments are suddenly low.
他们鼓励冒险，因为安全投资的回报突然变得很低。

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,910
People go out the risk curve to get the returns they want or need,
人们走出风险曲线以获得他们想要或需要的回报，

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,400
potentially into unwise investments.
可能进行不明智的投资。

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,560
They enable deals to be financed readily and cheaply.
它们使交易能够轻松且廉价地获得融资。

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,000
They encourage greater use of leverage.
他们鼓励更多地使用杠杆。

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,400
And that increases the fragility of companies and properties,
这增加了公司和财产的脆弱性，

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,680
as we're seeing now.
正如我们现在所看到的。

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,680
And it induces optimistic behavior that lays the groundwork for the next crisis.
它引发了乐观的行为，为下一次危机奠定了基础。

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,780
When I wrote "Easy Money,"
当我写《Easy Money》时，

00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,560
I talked about having read a book "The Price of Time" by Edward Chancellor.
我谈到读过 Edward Chancellor 的一本书《时间的代价》。

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,160
And he quotes the Manchester England banker John Mills.
他引用了曼彻斯特英格兰银行家约翰·米尔斯（John Mills）的话。

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,000
And I thought that in 1865, this comment was incredible.
我认为，在 1865 年，这个评论是不可思议的。

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,320
And I'm glad to highlight it for you.
我很高兴为您强调它。

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,640
We think of panics as producing losses.
我们认为恐慌会产生损失。

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,400
And panics as making things fall apart.
而恐慌就像让事情分崩离析一样。

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,720
But Mills said, as a rule, panics do not destroy capital.
但米尔斯表示，恐慌通常不会摧毁资本。

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:34,520
They merely reveal the extent to which it has previously been destroyed by its betrayal into hopelessly unproductive works.
它们只是揭示了它以前被背叛而毁坏的程度，变成了无可救药的无益作品。

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,440
The problem is not what happens at the lows.
问题不在于低点会发生什么。

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,150
The problem is what is done at the highs,
问题是在高点做了什么，

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,920
which then are disclosed at the lows.
然后在低点披露。

00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,440
Now, when something is the case for a long time,
现在，当事情发生很长时间时，

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,600
people believe it's normal.
人们认为这很正常。

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,080
And that's especially true in the investment business.
在投资业务中尤其如此。

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,980
When we have something in the environment for five,
当我们在环境中有 5 个对象时，

00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,240
10 years people think that's normalcy.
10 年人们认为这是常态。

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,440
And that's the way it's always going to be.
这就是它永远的方式。

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,690
Anyone who came into this business since 1980 had, until 42 years later,
直到 42 年后，任何从 1980 年开始进入这个行业的人都曾

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:13,210
essentially seen only declining interest rates or ultra low interest rates,
基本上只看到利率下降或超低利率，

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:13,960
or both.
或两者兼而有之。

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,270
In '21, of course,
当然，在 21 年，

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:23,240
we saw inflation in the green line reached a high of roughly 9.
我们看到绿线的通货膨胀率达到了大约 9 的高位。

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,740
Fed decided, eventually in late '21, that it had to respond,
美联储最终在 21 年末决定，它必须做出回应，

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,280
began to do so in the first quarter of '22.
从 22 年第一季度开始这样做。

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,520
That's the black line.
那是黑线。

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,120
And you could see the Fed funds rate went from 0 to 5 and 1/2,
你可以看到联邦基金利率从 0 到 5 和 1/2，

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,200
where it is today.
今天的情况。

00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,120
And that made the green line start bending down.
这使得绿线开始弯曲。

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,160
And it has come down quite well.
而且效果很好。

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,680
So I think that within two or three years,
所以我认为，在两三年内，

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,760
the Fed funds rate is likely to be in the threes and to settle there for the subsequent years,
联邦基金利率可能在 3 之间，并在随后几年稳定在那里，

00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,960
lower than today's 5 and 1/4, 5 and 1/2,
低于今天的 5 和 1/4、5 和 1/2，

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:05,320
but well above the 1/2% average that prevailed between '09 and '21.
但远高于 09 年至 21 年间普遍存在的 1/2% 的平均水平。

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,240
I resist the term higher for longer,
我抵制 Higher 这个词的时间更长，

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,000
because I don't think of race today as being higher.
因为我不认为今天的种族更高。

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,040
These are not high rates.
这些并不是高利率。

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,640
These are normal rates.
这些是正常费率。

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,710
But nevertheless,
但尽管如此，

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,280
they're a lot higher than what we lived through in the last 15 years.
它们比我们过去 15 年所经历的要高得多。

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,160
So the bottom line is that after a long period in which everything was unusually easy in the world of business,
所以，最重要的是，在商业世界中一切都异常轻松的很长一段时间之后，

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,700
finance, and investing,
金融和投资，

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,360
I think something to normalcy appears to be setting in.
我认为一些正常现象似乎正在形成。

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,960
And as a consequence, I believe economic growth may be slower.
因此，我认为经济增长可能会放缓。

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,120
Profit margins may be lower.
利润率可能更低。

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,280
Interest investor psychology may not be as uniformly positive.
兴趣投资者的心理可能并不那么积极。

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,120
Ownership interest may not appreciate as reliably.
所有者权益可能不会可靠地升值。

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,600
The cost of borrowing will not trend down consistently.
借贷成本不会持续下降。

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,560
Leverage is unlikely to add as much to results as it did in the period of declining rates.
杠杆率不太可能像利率下降时期那样为结果带来那么多好处。

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,300
Businesses may not find it as easy or as inexpensive to obtain financing,
企业可能发现获得融资并不容易或便宜。

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,560
and default rates may head higher.
违约率可能会更高。

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,670
In terms of conclusions,
就结论而言，

00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:11,720
Einstein said that insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.
爱因斯坦说，精神错乱就是一遍又一遍地做同样的事情，并期待不同的结果。

00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:19,200
I think another version of insanity is doing the same thing in a different environment and expecting the same result.
我认为另一种形式的疯狂是在不同的环境中做同样的事情，并期待同样的结果。

00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:28,360
So if the environment for business and investing is so thoroughly different in the coming five or 10 years,
因此，如果未来 5 年或 10 年的商业和投资环境如此彻底不同，

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,080
as it has been in the last 15 to 40 years,
就像过去 15 到 40 年一样，

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,240
I think it's folly to expect the same results.
我认为期望相同的结果是愚蠢的。

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:45,240
The investment environment and the starting point has a huge impact on the success of specific strategies.
投资环境和起点对特定策略的成功有着巨大的影响。

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:55,630
I believe strongly that the strategies that produce superior performance in the period of declining and ultra low rates may not be the ones that do so in the years ahead,
我坚信，在利率下滑和超低利率时期产生卓越表现的策略，在未来几年可能不会产生这种表现。

00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,880
or certainly not to the same extent.
或者肯定不是同样的程度。

00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,290
So the point is that lending or credit or fixed income investing,
所以关键是贷款、信贷或固定收益投资，

00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,280
whatever you want to call it,
无论你想怎么称呼它，

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,880
may be better off today than equity investing.
今天可能比股票投资更好。

00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,040
Liquid credit instruments offer yields in the high single digits.
流动性信贷工具提供高个位数的收益率。

00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,200
The yields on private credit are in the double digits.
私人信贷的收益率达到两位数。

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,060
These yields, number one,
这些产量，第一，

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,480
are highly competitive with the excellent historical returns on equities.
与出色的股票历史回报极具竞争力。

00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:31,000
These yields exceed most investors' required returns.
这些收益率超过了大多数投资者要求的回报。

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:40,200
And these yields are much less uncertain than the returns on equity and other ownership strategies.
而且这些收益率的不确定性远低于股本回报率和其他所有权策略。

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,760
They have a high probability of delivering what they promise.
他们很有可能兑现承诺。

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:52,820
I kind of summed up in C change by saying that investors can now potentially get solid returns from credit instruments,
我在 C change 中总结说，投资者现在有可能从信贷工具中获得可观的回报，

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:59,640
meaning they no longer have to rely as heavily on riskier investments to achieve their overall return targets.
这意味着他们不再需要严重依赖风险较高的投资来实现其整体回报目标。

00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,470
So the economist Paul Samuelson,
所以，经济学家保罗·萨缪尔森（Paul Samuelson），

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,560
who wrote the textbook that many of us read in college, said,
他写了我们许多人在大学里读过的教科书，他说：

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,320
"When events change, I change my mind.
“当事件发生变化时，我就会改变主意。

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,240
What do you do?" I believe that events have changed.
你怎么办？我相信情况已经发生了变化。

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,400
The environment has changed.
环境已经改变。

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
The climate for investing.
投资环境。

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,280
And what will you do about it?
你会怎么做呢？

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,300
Or to play devil's advocate,
或者扮演魔鬼的代言人，

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,360
