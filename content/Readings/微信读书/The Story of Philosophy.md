## P REFACE TO THE S ECOND E DITION


- 📌 Human knowledge had become too great for the human mind. ^CB-4Cl3s73t17UE6ko6keAXtBbC-1-3290-3346
    - ⏱ 2023-12-04 15:53:54 

- 📌 Every science, and every branch of philosophy, developed a technical terminology intelligible only to its exclusive devotees; as men learned more about the world, they found themselves ever less capable of expressing to their educated fellow-men what it was that they had learned. ^CB-4Cl3s73t17UE6ko6keAXtBbC-1-4309-4589
    - ⏱ 2023-12-04 15:54:29 

- 📌 The gap between life and knowledge grew wider and wider; those who governed could not understand those who thought, and those who wanted to know could not understand those who knew. ^CB-4Cl3s73t17UE6ko6keAXtBbC-1-4590-4772
    - ⏱ 2023-12-04 15:54:53 

- 📌 This book is not a complete history of philosophy. It is an attempt to humanize knowledge by centering the story of speculative thought around certain dominant personalities. Certain lesser figures have been omitted in order that those selected might have the space required to make them live. (Preface.) ^CB-4Cl3s73t17UE6ko6keAXtBbC-1-14966-15337
    - ⏱ 2023-12-04 22:52:27 

- 📌 Nevertheless the incompleteness remained. The worst sin of all—though the critics do not seem to have noticed it—was the omission of Chinese and Hindu philosophy. Even a “story” of philosophy that begins with Socrates, and has nothing to say about Lao-tze and Confucius, Mencius and Chwang-tze, Buddha and Shankara, is provincially incomplete.1 ^CB-4Cl3s73t17UE6ko6keAXtBbC-1-15470-16000
    - ⏱ 2023-12-04 22:54:11 

- 📌 中国哲学家不仅厌恶认识论，而且几乎对长期存在的形而上学嗤之以鼻。没有哪个年轻的形而上学家会承认孔子是哲学家，因为他对形而上学只字不提，对认识论更是只字不提；他像斯宾塞或孔德一样是实证论者；他关心的总是道德和国家。更糟糕的是，他令人不齿地易于理解；对哲学家来说，没有什么比这更具破坏性了。但是，我们“现代人”已经如此习惯于哲学中的浮夸之辞，以至于当哲学没有这些浮夸之辞时，我们很难识别它。对晦涩的偏见必须付出代价。 ^CB-4Cl3s73t17UE6ko6keAXtBbC-1-20126-20332

## I NTRODUCTION : O N THE U SES OF P HILOSOPHY


- 📌 我们生活中的很多东西都是没有意义的，一种自我抵消的摇摆和徒劳；我们努力与周围的混乱和内心的混乱作斗争；但我们始终相信，只要我们能解读自己的灵魂，我们身上就有一些重要和有意义的东西。 ^CB-4Cl3s73t17UE6ko6keAXtBbC-2-4061-4151
    - ⏱ 2023-12-04 23:05:14 

- 📌 要成为一个哲学家，”梭罗说，“不仅仅是要有敏锐的思想，甚至不是要创立一个学派，而是要热爱智慧，按照智慧的指示，过一种简单、独立、慷慨、信任的生活。” ^CB-4Cl3s73t17UE6ko6keAXtBbC-2-4438-4512
    - ⏱ 2023-12-04 23:05:31 

- 📌 首先寻求心灵的善，”培根告诫我们，“其余的要么会得到满足，要么不会感到失去。”真理不会使我们富有，但它会使我们自由。 ^CB-4Cl3s73t17UE6ko6keAXtBbC-2-4543-4601
    - ⏱ 2023-12-04 23:05:38 

- 📌 stagnant? Science seems always to advance, while philosophy seems always to lose ground. Yet this is only because philosophy accepts the hard and hazardous task of dealing with problems not yet open to the methods of science—problems like good and evil, beauty and ugliness, order and freedom, life and death; so soon as a field of inquiry yields knowledge susceptible of exact formulation it is called science. Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art ^CB-4Cl3s73t17UE6ko6keAXtBbC-2-5216-5678
    - ⏱ 2023-12-07 13:05:13 

- 📌 处理科学方法还无法解决的问题——诸如善与恶、美与丑、秩序与自由、生与死等问题；只要一个研究领域产生了可以用精确公式表达的知识，它就被称为科学。 ^CB-4Cl3s73t17UE6ko6keAXtBbC-2-6549-6620
    - ⏱ 2023-12-07 13:09:02 

- 📌 philosophy means and includes five fields of study and discourse: logic, esthetics, ethics, politics, and metaphysics. Logic is the study of ideal method in thought and research: observation and introspection, deduction and induction, hypothesis and experiment, analysis and synthesis—such are the forms of human activity which logic tries to understand and guide; ^CB-4Cl3s73t17UE6ko6keAXtBbC-2-9270-9663
