- 📌 Those who tackle the impossible are not just innovating in matter but also in mind ^CB-9EACp8CpRC676hf6gX5SC079-6-1406-1488

- 📌 happy or sad is just what happens on the way to accomplishing the impossible or not accomplishing the impossible. More meaningful does not typically mean more pleasant. ^CB-9EACp8CpRC676hf6gX5SC079-6-4279-4528
