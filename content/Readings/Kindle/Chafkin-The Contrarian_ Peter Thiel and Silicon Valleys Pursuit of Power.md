技术博客Gizmodo发表了一份报告，声称保守派的意见被社交网络系统地抑制。一小组编辑们从事一项名为“趋势主题”的新功能的编辑团队说，他们被指示包括来自CNN和《纽约时报》等主流媒体的故事，但要忽略右翼媒体的故事，以及关于在保守派中流行的边缘主题的故事， — location: [129]() ^ref-42821

he has been, in many ways, the most influential. His first company, PayPal, pioneered ecommerce and—after being spun out of the company to which Thiel sold it, eBay—is worth nearly $300 billion, as of early 2021. Palantir, his second company, popularized the concept of data mining after 9/11 and paved the way for what critics of the technology industry call surveillance capitalism. More recently, it became a key player in the Trump administration’s immigration and defense projects. — location: [273]() ^ref-15144

How had Thiel, who’d arrived in Silicon Valley in the mid-’90s as an unknown, failed financier, come to wield so much power? He was a contrarian, yes, but contrarianism is a methodology, not an ideology. What exactly, I wondered, did Thiel actually believe? And how deeply embedded were those beliefs in Silicon Valley itself? — location: [356]() ^ref-64296

These questions matter because they are the same ones we are asking of the big tech companies that the Thielverse gave us. In part because he was instrumental in building it, and in part because so many powerful people came to admire and copy him, much of Silicon Valley is today a reflection of Thiel’s worldview, for better or worse.
