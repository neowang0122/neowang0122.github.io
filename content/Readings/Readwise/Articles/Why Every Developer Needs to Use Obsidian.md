- Full Title: Why Every Developer Needs to Use Obsidian
- Category: #articles

## Highlights
- Code snippets (sure you can use gists or a repo, but i want context with my code snippets and i want it to be searchable)
- It means the notes you painstakingly curate are not locked into a single echo-system, you can shift between them as long as whatever your shifting to supports markdown.
- You also get greater control over how you backup and manage change tracking.
