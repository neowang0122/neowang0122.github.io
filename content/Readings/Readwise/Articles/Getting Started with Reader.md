## Highlights
- you can finally highlight images! And those highlighted images, like all highlights in Reader, will be synced with and resurfaced in Readwise and/or your note-taking app of choice ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2xn1z0zjhn7wcbypnwv8an))
- hit `z` to undo any action ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2xnpy8wfpzsce07ntrwpre))
- Try tapping `[` and/or `]` to hide them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2xqyx32fd154pa48geqy1g))
- tapping `n` to both highlight and start a note on the focused paragraph ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2xrhfcejprrh1q36bdgkd1))
- Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`), or tapping `?` for the quick reference. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2xrvsx96gjv4kp2e1vwa7e))
- browser extension has one massive bonus feature. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2xtf1jw6ex046mm3rd8swe))
- a web highlighter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2xt0t9wam2pv14gr3w4gp5))
- This means you can optionally highlight the native web page, just like with Hypothes.is or Liner. And those highlights will bidirectionally sync with the Reader web and mobile apps. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2xtqadc864288wnmv5tzfh))
- Second, although our parsing already exceeds Instapaper and Pocket in our benchmark tests, we'll never be able to parse 100% of the internet, 100% perfectly. HTML and CSS are just too flexible. The web highlighter is our exception handler. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2xwv4ajp5ybzaxft2t7ng5))
- **Double tap to highlight.** The mobile analog of using the keyboard shortcut `h` to highlight an entire paragraph is double tapping. If you're reading this on mobile, try double tapping this paragraph. It's awesome. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2xy11rjakqm8fr52g8dkm8))
- hands-free TTS listening is particularly well-suited for consuming low information density content ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2xzxn088yc8mnybk89yzqg))
- If you've got a bunch of ~5 minute news articles and press releases sitting in your queue, you might try listening to them on your next walk, drive, bike ride, dishwashing, et cetera. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2y053mxjjeqd4hbd101616))
- Second, our implementation of TTS includes accurate word mapping enabling a form of reading sometimes referred to as immersion reading. This refers to simultaneously reading and listening to the same document. It's a kind of sensory deprivation technique enabling you to quickly ramp into a flow state which would otherwise take 15 to 20 minutes of focused reading to attain. This is clearly anecdotal, but you might give it a shot to see how you like it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2y0rsd7fqm2d73zhzdxjfz))
- highlighting YouTube videos ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2y15qmh13x7zc5dzzgb7vz))
- In Reader, you can watch a YouTube video alongside its time-synced transcript, and take notes and highlights as it plays. You can also precisely navigate the video by clicking any fragment, clicking a highlight in the right sidebar, or using special keyboard controls ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2y1vyxr3tx57z7m7yw9ffn))
- Think of the Library section as your permanent archive of digital documents: a place of high signal and low noise ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2y2fdjj8jz2vzew5qgfjfp))
- Library is where documents that you manually save for yourself, such as clipping an article with the browser extension, reside ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2y2n94kdt17y9r3x5m73wd))
- These documents can then be managed through the triage statuses of Inbox (for newly saved documents), Later (for documents you intend to read but don't have time right now), and Archive (for documents you're finished with at the moment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2y2xv9dpytty2bmt1bx0ch))
- The Feed section, on the other hand, is where documents that are automatically "pushed" to you by others, such as RSS subscriptions and email newsletters, initially reside: a place of low signal and high noise. You can, of course, save something from Feed to Library for safekeeping, but this is an intentional choice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2y3d6j5t343ncdjskxcb85))
