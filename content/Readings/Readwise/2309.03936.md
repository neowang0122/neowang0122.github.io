## Highlights
- 0-1200 MHz), archival Low Frequency Array (LOFAR; 144 MHz), and Very Large Array (VLA; 1.4 and 3 GHz) data. Five of the quasars in our sample have been discovered recently, representing some of the highest redshift radio bright quasars known at low-frequencies. We model their radio spectra to study their radio emission mechanism and age of the radio jets by constraining the spectral turnover caused by synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) or free-free absorption (FFA). Besides J0309+2717, a blazar at z = 6.1, our quasars show no sign of a spectral flattening ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha30e8ybc75v0f63esbp2vw5))
- rame frequency of 0.6-2.3 GHz (90-330 MHz observed frame), with a high-frequency break indicative of radiative ageing of the electron population i ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha30eajzx4e8gxtn52cjmvjx))
