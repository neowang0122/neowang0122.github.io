1.      The Psychology of Money Timeless L [>>](marginnote3app://note/DD065282-A95D-4EA8-BE58-A2BD0B04C4F5)

2.      “A  genius is the man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind.”—Napoleon [>>](marginnote3app://note/1EAE0F16-3443-4C18-A773-6FAF8F295D86)

3.      “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.”—Sherlock Holmes [>>](marginnote3app://note/BB1EBADB-1295-48B3-8A04-5057A81623F0)

4.      The premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. [>>](marginnote3app://note/D1EAC222-8D1F-4703-959A-21567BC1CA7E)

5.      A genius who loses control of their emotions can be a financial disaster [>>](marginnote3app://note/DE92CA41-5A02-4532-8F20-588EF179B35D)

6.      Read saved what little he could and invested it in blue chip stocks. Then he waited, for decades on end, as tiny savings compounded into more than $ 8 million. [>>](marginnote3app://note/7CD19E84-F211-47E2-A3C5-68BEB3BDC638)

7.      Ronald Read was patient; Richard Fuscone was greedy. That’s all it took to eclipse the massive education and experience gap between the two. [>>](marginnote3app://note/7E923427-8C09-41D5-95FC-B64C9DCC8059)

8.      The fascinating thing about these stories is how unique they are to finance. In what other industry does someone with no college degree, no training, no background, no formal experience, and no connections massively outperform someone with the best education, the best training, and the best connections? [>>](marginnote3app://note/63789D52-6306-4EB3-9A6B-1344A5C02544)

9.      The fact that Ronald Read can coexist with Richard Fuscone has two explanations. One, financial outcomes are driven by luck, independent of intelligence and effort. That’s true to some extent, and this book will discuss it in further detail. Or, two (and I think more common), that financial success is not a hard science. It’s a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know. [>>](marginnote3app://note/2FED96C6-F155-4C43-8F03-A062C44313C4)

10.      Two topics impact everyone, whether you are interested in them or not: health and money. [>>](marginnote3app://note/51E79F66-E2C2-4DF8-B12B-8D4A64F8BBF4)

11.      Finance has scooped up the smartest minds coming from top universities over the last two decades. Financial Engineering was the most popular major in Princeton’s School of Engineering a decade ago. Is there any evidence it has made us better investors? [>>](marginnote3app://note/939F48C6-16BD-4293-8099-3C04D02AE5BB)

14.      Are we less likely to bury ourselves in debt? [>>](marginnote3app://note/A8E33E3D-6DBE-43E6-A714-4E4DE00C9B75)

15.      Most of the reason why, I believe, is that we think about and are taught about money in ways that are too much like physics (with rules and laws) and not enough like psychology (with emotions and nuance). [>>](marginnote3app://note/472E7203-D094-416B-9A24-76675B927525)

16.      Money is everywhere, it affects all of us, and confuses most of us. Everyone thinks about it a little differently. It offers lessons on things that apply to many areas of life, like risk, confidence, and happiness. Few topics offer a more powerful magnifying glass that helps explain why people behave the way they do than money. It is one of the greatest shows on Earth. [>>](marginnote3app://note/693D437C-ADAD-46F9-B867-966FF6C0F1BA)

17.      My own appreciation for the psychology of money is shaped by more than a decade of writing on the topic. I began writing about finance in early 2008. It was the dawn of a financial crisis and the worst recession in 80 years. [>>](marginnote3app://note/D6C5B85D-BBED-4DCB-BD2A-F7614D2CB5A8)

18.      To write about what was happening, I wanted to figure out what was happening. But the first thing I learned after the financial crisis was that no one could accurately explain what happened, or why it happened, let alone what should be done about it. For every good explanation there was an equally convincing rebuttal. [>>](marginnote3app://note/265300E7-6673-4EB1-B166-A4D31A0237D8)

19.      Finance is different. It’s guided by people’s behaviors. And how I behave might make sense to me but look crazy to you. [>>](marginnote3app://note/47245904-A1ED-453A-B490-773CEEE763B8)

20.      The more I studied and wrote about the financial crisis, the more I realized that you could understand it better through the lenses of psychology and history, not finance. [>>](marginnote3app://note/912B7C2F-EC1D-4B09-A9F5-4FDB793E7B1C)

21.      To grasp why people bury themselves in debt you don’t need to study interest rates; you need to study the history of greed, insecurity, and optimism. [>>](marginnote3app://note/A80875B0-36F0-44C7-8515-F9BB7FFE58E7)

22.      I love Voltaire’s observation that “History never repeats itself; man always does.” It applies so well to how we behave with money. [>>](marginnote3app://note/229B99B3-6ED1-410A-9820-46C509E468EF)

23.      ![](file:////Users/neowang/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image002.jpg)       [>>](marginnote3app://note/649ADDB1-E863-4730-AC4C-8C0D7B7C19FA)

24.      Everyone has their own unique experience with how the world works. And what you’ve experienced is more compelling than what you learn secondhand. [>>](marginnote3app://note/B3FCD2A1-23B0-4567-9A7F-CEDEFEDFEC74)

25.      So all of us—you, me, everyone—go through life anchored to a set of views about how money works that vary wildly from person to person. What seems crazy to you might make sense to me. [>>](marginnote3app://note/8F73C322-9EE1-4D7A-8077-760BEAC5CF16)

26.      Here’s the thing: People from different generations, raised by different parents who earned different incomes and held different values, in different parts of the world, born into different economies, experiencing different job markets with different incentives and different degrees of luck, learn very different lessons. [>>](marginnote3app://note/6F1A91B9-C3F9-4EB2-99F8-7DE449FA0BEC)

27.      You know stuff about money that I don’t, and vice versa. You go through life with different beliefs, goals, and forecasts, than I do. That’s not because one of us is smarter than the other, or has better information. It’s because we’ve had different lives shaped by different and equally persuasive experiences. [>>](marginnote3app://note/EDC79AC0-588F-43B4-B5E8-2D8A7147D31F)

28.      The challenge for us is that no amount of studying or open-mindedness can genuinely recreate the power of fear and uncertainty. [>>](marginnote3app://note/40A82B62-27F6-4C97-BB4C-1695FFB2D859)

29.      I can read about what it was like to lose everything during the Great Depression. But I don’t have the emotional scars of those who actually experienced it. And the person who lived through it can’t fathom why someone like me could come across as complacent about things like owning stocks. [>>](marginnote3app://note/4056D5A8-F3BE-480D-8780-1085CB2A4C17)

30.      Spreadsheets can model the historic frequency of big stock market declines. But they can’t model the feeling of coming home, looking at your kids, and wondering if you’ve made a mistake that will impact their lives. Studying history makes you feel like you understand something. But until you’ve lived through it and personally felt its consequences, you may not understand it enough to change your behavior. [>>](marginnote3app://note/339ED3C3-8511-4B31-A7CF-7A0BC8078F26)

31.      As investor Michael Batnick says, “some lessons have to be experienced before they can be understood.” We are all victims, in different ways, to that truth. [>>](marginnote3app://note/C940CD2F-97DC-4A1E-8DBD-5A50736B09E1)

32.      In theory people should make investment decisions based on their goals and the characteristics of the investment options available to them at the time. But that’s not what people do. [>>](marginnote3app://note/E7598E1E-7CD0-4EC5-8D74-8F9245773E13)

33.      The economists found that people’s lifetime investment decisions are heavily anchored to the experiences those investors had in their own generation—especially experiences early in their adult life. [>>](marginnote3app://note/831FC9F6-CE21-4ABB-8F09-B66A18D5A8E0)

34.      If you grew up when inflation was high, you invested less of your money in bonds later in life compared to those who grew up when inflation was low. If you happened to grow up when the stock market was strong, you invested more of your money in stocks later in life compared to those who grew up when stocks were weak. The economists wrote: “Our findings suggest that individual investors’willingness to bear risk depends on personal history.” [>>](marginnote3app://note/F13C7762-68CB-4181-9529-075B6FC35F10)

35.      Not intelligence, or education, or sophistication. J ust the dumb luck of when and where you were born. [>>](marginnote3app://note/014394FF-B94E-46D9-B355-6497982E98FD)

36.      The Financial Times interviewed Bill Gross, the famed bond manager, in 2019. “Gross admits that he would probably not be where he is today if he had been born a decade earlier or later,” the piece said. Gross’s career coincided almost perfectly with a generational collapse in interest rates that gave bond prices a tailwind. That kind of thing doesn’t just affect the opportunities you come across; it affects what you think about those opportunities when they’re presented to you. To Gross, bonds were wealthgenerating machines. To his father’s generation, who grew up with and endured higher inflation, they might be seen as wealth incinerators. [>>](marginnote3app://note/D5559115-FC0F-44EF-AC6D-0B9BDD7AA868)

37.      Take stocks. If you were born in 1970, the S& P 500 increased almost 10fold, adjusted for inflation, during your teens and 20s. That’s an amazing return. If you were born in 1950, the market went literally nowhere in your teens and 20s adjusted for inflation. Two groups of people, separated by chance of their birth year, go through life with a completely different view on how the stock market works: [>>](marginnote3app://note/5DFAE2DF-E819-469E-903F-9C2B3296DECB)

38.      ![](file:////Users/neowang/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image004.jpg)       [>>](marginnote3app://note/F67B2FEF-F9D8-4792-84B0-678B6F142AAE)

39.      No one should expect members of these groups to go through the rest of their lives thinking the same thing about inflation. Or the stock market. Or unemployment. Or money in general. [>>](marginnote3app://note/1216E581-353C-408A-ACCE-C6A89A6272A9)

40.      No one should expect them to respond to financial information the same way. No one should assume they are influenced by the same incentives. [>>](marginnote3app://note/BAB3CBA2-58C7-4735-990F-8A44A2E4116C)

41.      No one should expect them to trust the same sources of advice. No one should expect them to agree on what matters, what’s worth it, what’s likely to happen next, and what the best path forward is. [>>](marginnote3app://note/8EBDDF38-DD36-4D4D-A538-1D8F5CC72F61)

42.      Their view of money was formed in different worlds. And when that’s the case, a view about money that one group of people thinks is outrageous can make perfect sense to another. A few years ago, The New York Times did a story on the working conditions of Foxconn, the massive Taiwanese electronics manufacturer. The conditions are often atrocious. Readers were rightly upset. But a fascinating response to the story came from the nephew of a Chinese worker, who wrote in the comment section:  My aunt worked several years in what Americans call “sweat shops.” It was hard work. Long hours, “small” wage, “poor” working conditions. Do you know what my aunt did before she worked in one of these factories? She was a prostitute. The idea of working in a “sweat shop” compared to that old lifestyle is an improvement, in my opinion. I know that my aunt would rather be “exploited” by an evil capitalist boss for a couple of dollars than have her body be exploited by several men for pennies. That is why I am upset by many Americans’ thinking. We do not have the same opportunities as the West. Our governmental infrastructure is different. The country is different. Yes, factory is hard labor. Could it be better? Yes, but only when you compare such to American jobs. [>>](marginnote3app://note/F009DE61-FEAB-4E5C-BCED-0094CA22F686)

43.      Every decision people make with money is justified by taking the information they have at the moment and plugging it into their unique mental model of how the world works. [>>](marginnote3app://note/7D103730-7A41-4E01-930F-9CDE098E3DC7)

44.      Those people can be misinformed. They can have incomplete information. They can be bad at math. They can be persuaded by rotten marketing. They can have no idea what they’re doing. They can misjudge the consequences of their actions. Oh, can they ever. But every financial decision a person makes, makes sense to them in that moment and checks the boxes they need to check. They tell themselves a story about what they’re doing and why they’re doing it, and that story has been shaped by their own unique experiences. [>>](marginnote3app://note/10AFBB66-CBE6-4659-8D91-389D2254FEF3)

45.      Take a simple example: lottery tickets. Americans spend more on them than movies, video games, music, sporting events, and books combined. And who buys them? Mostly poor people. The lowest-income households in the U.S. on average spend $ 412 a year on lotto tickets, four times the amount of those in the highest income groups. Forty percent of Americans cannot come up with $ 400 in an emergency. Which is to say: Those buying $ 400 in lottery tickets are by and large the same people who say they couldn’t come up with $ 400 in an emergency. They are blowing their safety nets on something with a one-in-millions chance of hitting it big. [>>](marginnote3app://note/8F1577EE-E776-4DAD-AFF4-B59AD0E628A5)

46.      We live paycheck-to-paycheck and saving seems out of reach. Our prospects for much higher wages seem out of reach. We can’t afford nice vacations, new cars, health insurance, or homes in safe neighborhoods. We can’t put our kids through college without crippling debt. Much of the stuff you people who read finance books either have now, or have a good chance of getting, we don’t. Buying a lottery ticket is the only time in our lives we can hold a tangible dream of getting the good stuff that you already have and take for granted. We are paying for a dream, and you may not understand that because you are already living a dream. That’s why we buy more tickets than you do. [>>](marginnote3app://note/428F1CEF-8CF9-44F1-9339-5567813A2C22)

47.      Few people make financial decisions purely with a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a company meeting. Places where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together into a narrative that works for you.

48.      the modern foundation of money decisions—saving and investing—is based around concepts that are practically infants. [>>](marginnote3app://note/E2387807-6A1B-4969-9A63-D828A2572C2F)

49.      We all do crazy stuff with money, because we’re all relatively new to this game and what looks crazy to you might make sense to me. But no one is crazy—we all make decisions based on our own unique experiences that seem to make sense to us in a given moment. [>>](marginnote3app://note/87B92503-85AD-4AC0-9B88-A31BFD4D3BB0)

50.      NYU professor Scott Galloway has a related idea that is so important to remember when judging success—both your own and others’: “Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems [>>](marginnote3app://note/9A188B31-7392-47DE-B2B5-C1FC7DECAA5B)

51.      Luck and risk are siblings. They are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. [>>](marginnote3app://note/37FD4D7F-C49A-4BA7-8F84-0638A761EB45)

52.      Bill Gates went to one of the only high schools in the world that had a computer. The story of how Lakeside School, just outside Seattle, even got a computer is remarkable. Bill Dougall was a World War II navy pilot turned high school math and science teacher. “He believed that book study wasn’t enough without realworld experience. He also realized that we’d need to know something about computers when we got to college,” recalled late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. In 1968 Dougall petitioned the Lakeside School Mothers’ Club to use the proceeds from its annual rummage sale—about $ 3,000—to lease a Teletype Model 30 computer hooked up to the General Electric mainframe terminal for computer time-sharing. “The whole idea of time-sharing only got invented in 1965,” Gates later said. “Someone was pretty forwardlooking.”Most university graduate schools did not have a computer anywhere near as advanced as Bill Gates had access to in eighth grade. And he couldn’t get enough of it. Gates was 13 years old in 1968 when he met classmate Paul Allen. Allen was also obsessed with the school’s computer, and the two hit it off. Lakeside’s computer wasn’t part of its general curriculum. It was an independent study program. Bill and Paul could toy away with the thing at [>>](marginnote3app://note/2F9E7681-4F18-4362-B7F1-FC426EAEE6EF)

54.      During one of their late-night sessions, Allen recalled Gates showing him a Fortune magazine and saying, “What do you think it’s like to run a Fortune 500 company?” Allen said he had no idea. “Maybe we’ll have our own computer company someday,” Gates said. Microsoft is now worth more than a trillion dollars. [>>](marginnote3app://note/EE7BB17F-B7B9-489F-9B42-AF329C5EC089)

55.      Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. They are so similar that you can’t believe in one without equally respecting the other. They both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You are one person in a game with seven billion other people and infinite moving parts. The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take. [>>](marginnote3app://note/59B31BD6-EEA1-4736-9857-3281893EA7FB)

56.      When judging others, attributing success to luck makes you look jealous and mean, even if we know it exists. And when judging yourself, attributing success to luck can be too demoralizing to accept. [>>](marginnote3app://note/1DDF0AF6-7F32-462E-87DB-4627A36A7146)

57.      Economist Bhashkar Mazumder has shown that incomes among brothers are more correlated than height or weight. If you are rich and tall, your brother is more likely to also be rich than he is tall. I think most of us intuitively know this is true—the quality of your education and the doors that open for you are heavily linked to your parents’ socioeconomic status. [>>](marginnote3app://note/C487529E-9354-49C6-B02E-AE2FF17A5D0F)

58.      When judging your failures I’m likely to prefer a clean and simple story of cause and effect, because I don’t know what’s going on inside your head. “You had a bad outcome so it must have been caused by a bad decision” is the story that makes the most sense to me. But when judging myself I can make up a wild narrative justifying my past decisions and attributing bad outcomes to risk. [>>](marginnote3app://note/25212861-3259-4CA7-B4C6-FD368D575ED4)

59.      Benjamin Graham is known as one of the greatest investors of all time, the father of value investing and the early mentor of Warren Buffett. But the majority of Benjamin Graham’s investing success was due to owning an enormous chunk of GEICO stock which, by his own admission, broke nearly every diversification rule that Graham himself laid out in his famous texts. Where does the thin line between bold and reckless fall here? I don’t know. Graham wrote about his GEICO bonanza: “One lucky break, or one supremely shrewd decision—can we tell them apart?” Not easily. [>>](marginnote3app://note/0EC06499-5AD6-4181-BBB8-F9CC83B3C0D5)

61.      The difficulty in identifying what is luck, what is skill, and what is risk is one of the biggest problems we face when trying to learn about the best way to manage money. But two things can point you in a better direction.  Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming. [>>](marginnote3app://note/C8BFCC9D-0C91-4E5A-A3FC-0DEBA092736B)

62.      Or, just be careful when assuming that 100% of outcomes can be attributed to effort and decisions. After my son was born, I wrote him a letter that said, in part:  Some people are born into families that encourage education; others are against it. Some are born into flourishing economies encouraging of entrepreneurship; others are born into war and destitution. I want you to be successful, and I want you to earn it. But realize that not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself.

65.      My favorite historian, Frederick Lewis Allen, spent his career depicting the life of the average, median American—how they lived, how they changed, what they did for work, what they ate for dinner, etc. There are more relevant lessons to take away from this kind of broad observation than there are in studying the extreme characters that tend to dominate the news.

67.      When things are going extremely well, realize it’s not as good as you think. You are not invincible, and if you acknowledge that luck brought you success then you have to believe in luck’s cousin, risk, which can turn your story around just as quickly.

76.      But it’s one of the most important. If expectations rise with results there is no logic in striving for more because you’ll feel the same after putting in extra effort. It gets dangerous when the taste of having more—more money, more power, more prestige—increases ambition faster than satisfaction. In that case one step forward pushes the goalpost two steps ahead. You feel as if you’re falling behind, and the only way to catch up is to take greater and greater amounts of risk. Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth and generating envy. Perhaps they go hand in hand; wanting to surpass your peers can be the fuel of hard work. But life isn’t any fun without a sense of enough. Happiness, as it’s said, is just results minus expectations. [>>](marginnote3app://note/E496125B-1FFD-40E8-979B-DD41A78E22E5)

77.      The point is that the ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it. Which means it’s a battle that can never be won, or that the only way to win is to not fight to begin with—to accept that you might have enough, even if it’s less than those around you. A friend of mine makes an annual pilgrimage to Las Vegas. One year he asked a dealer: What games do you play, and what casinos do you play in? The dealer, stone-cold serious, replied: “The only way to win in a Las Vegas casino is to exit as soon as you enter.”That’s exactly how the game of trying to keep up with other people’s wealth works, too.

85.      The big takeaway from ice ages is that you don’t need tremendous force to create tremendous results. If something compounds—if a little growth serves as the fuel for future growth—a small starting base can lead to results so extraordinary they seem to defy logic.

Warren, Charlie, and Rick made investments together and interviewed business managers together. Then Rick kind of disappeared, at least relative to Buffett and Munger’s success. Investor Mohnish Pabrai once asked Buffett what happened to Rick. Mohnish recalled:  [ Warren said]  “Charlie and I always knew that we would become incredibly wealthy. We were not in a hurry to get wealthy; we knew it would happen. Rick was just as smart as us, but he was in a hurry.”What happened was that in the 1973– 1974 downturn, Rick was levered with margin loans. And the stock market went down almost 70% in those two years, so he got margin calls. He sold his Berkshire stock to Warren—Warren actually said “I bought Rick’s Berkshire stock”—at under $ 40 a piece. Rick was forced to sell because he was levered.18 [>>](marginnote3app://note/E3F27331-0DE6-4C63-9CCA-A7AA2FB565EC)

154.      Investor Bill Mann once wrote: “There is no faster way to feel rich than to spend lots of money on really nice things. But the way to be rich is to spend money you have, and to not spend money you don’t have. It’s really that simple.”31 [>>](marginnote3app://note/7068D60F-4177-4AF1-A590-73BF8AE9423D)

155.      The only way to be wealthy is to not spend the money that you do have. It’s not just the only way to accumulate wealth; it’s the very definition of wealth. [>>](marginnote3app://note/59A232FD-7569-4786-88D1-00EB6087CAAB)

156.      R ich is a current income. Someone driving a $ 100,000 car is almost certainly rich, because even if they purchased the car with debt you need a certain level of income to afford the monthly payment. Same with those who live in big homes. It’s not hard to spot rich people. They often go out of their way to make themselves known. [>>](marginnote3app://note/41973F04-05CF-481F-9D20-512DFA8A0670)

157.      But wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent. Wealth is an option not yet taken to buy something later. Its value lies in offering you options, flexibility, and growth to one day purchase more stuff than you could right now. [>>](marginnote3app://note/727A4A11-DE36-44C8-B663-B349E3E3BC20)

163.      The first idea—simple, but easy to overlook—is that building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate. [>>](marginnote3app://note/AF828D6E-9B2C-46D6-9B33-8ABCDCB350DF)

164.      Investment returns can make you rich. But whether an investing strategy will work, and how long it will work for, and whether markets will cooperate, is always in doubt. Results are shrouded in uncertainty. [>>](marginnote3app://note/C8D17AB7-46E7-4C76-9C88-95D5F007A80F)

171.      Intelligence is not a reliable advantage in a world that’s become as connected as ours has. But flexibility is. In a world where intelligence is hyper-competitive and many previous technical skills have become automated, competitive advantages tilt toward nuanced and soft skills—like communication, empathy, and, perhaps most of all, flexibility.

175.      With it comes something that often goes overlooked: Do not aim to be coldly rational when making financial decisions. Aim to just be pretty reasonable. Reasonable is more realistic and you have a better chance of sticking with it for the long run, which is what matters most when managing money.

177.      Harry Markowitz won the Nobel Prize for exploring the mathematical tradeoff between risk and return. He was once asked how he invested his own money, and described his portfolio allocation in the 1950s, when his models were first developed:  I visualized my grief if the stock market went way up and I wasn’t in it—or if it went way down and I was completely in it. My intention was to minimize my future regret. So I split my contributions 50/ 50 between bonds and equities. [>>](marginnote3app://note/8475C845-D162-41B8-9EFF-F4B6D64A5938)

178.      Markowitz is neither rational or irrational. He’s reasonable. What’s often overlooked in finance is that something can be technically true but contextually nonsense. [>>](marginnote3app://note/D4C53C10-E78A-4ACD-931B-0594F7D55365)

184.      But investing is not a hard science. It’s a massive group of people making imperfect decisions with limited information about things that will have a massive impact on their wellbeing, which can make even smart people nervous, greedy and paranoid.

185.      The mental trick we play on ourselves here is an over-admiration of people who have been there, done that, when it comes to money. Experiencing specific events does not necessarily qualify you to know what will happen next. In fact it rarely does, because experience leads to overconfidence more than forecasting ability.

187.      The thing that makes tail events easy to underappreciate is how easy it is to underestimate how things compound. How, for example, 9/ 11 prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which helped drive the housing bubble, which led to the financial crisis, which led to a poor jobs market, which led tens of millions to seek a college education [>>](marginnote3app://note/F9E587E3-54C1-4737-B0B4-02EBAE0806EE)
