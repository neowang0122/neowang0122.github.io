**Good morning.** These are truly polarizing times. A cold snap is about to freeze much of the country with the lowest temps of the winter so far, with Chicago forecast to shiver at -10 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday.

And for anyone headed to the Chiefs–Dolphins playoff game in Kansas City tomorrow, here’s one thing to keep in mind: layers. The windchill is expected to drop to -24 degrees by the end of the game. If you’re thinking, “No way Miami can handle that,” you’d be correct. The Dolphins have lost 10 straight games when the temp at kickoff is 40 degrees or below.

Microsoft unseated Apple yesterday as the world’s most valuable publicly traded company…and then gave the throne right back.

The AI-fueled stock rally that Microsoft has enjoyed for months finally buoyed the software company’s market capitalization to $2.9 trillion Thursday morning, briefly edging past Apple’s $2.89 trillion. Apple had been the most valuable company in the world for a year and a half, and on-and-off for more than a decade.

Apple was back on top by midday, but [Microsoft’s momentary reign](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g4u?mblid=f8ee098a69a5&mbcid=33973766.4026052&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)—the fourth time it’s briefly overtaken Apple since 2018—indicates that the tables may be turning between these longtime rivals.

## From allies to enemies to cordial competitors

Microsoft and Apple were simpatico in the earliest days of Big Tech, when desktops created by Steve Jobs used software developed by Bill Gates. Relations got rockier in the 1980s when Apple sued Microsoft for allegedly ripping off its Macintosh software (Apple lost), and in the 1990s when Jobs publicly trashed Microsoft’s products.

**But then Microsoft saved Apple.** In 1997, Apple was near bankruptcy when Microsoft invested $150 million to keep the Mac-maker afloat. Jobs called Gates and personally thanked him for the lifeboat.

## Fast-forward to today

Microsoft and Apple account for \~14% of the S&P 500\. In the past year…

* Shares in Microsoft increased by 63%, compared with 39% for Apple, per the [Wall Street Journal](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g4w?mblid=e82b1e8e8fb5&mbcid=33973766.4026052&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

With the trial over, Judge Engoron—who was the victim of a “swatting” incident [at his home](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g45?mblid=96da1257285f&mbcid=33973766.4026052&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) on Thursday—will now decide the verdict himself, since there’s no jury.

But with volatile food and fuel prices stripped out, the “core” inflation measure came in at 3.9% in the year through December, down from 4% in 2022 and the first time that metric’s been below 4% since May 2021\.

Hertz is wondering if you’d be down to just…buy that Tesla you rented? The rental car company said yesterday it’s [selling](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g4B?mblid=5a37bc1072f8&mbcid=33973766.4026052&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) 20,000 electric vehicles from its US EV fleet of around 50,000, and will use some of the money to buy some old-fashioned gas-powered cars.

**A strategy 180 so hard it left skid marks.** In 2021, Hertz snagged media attention after it emerged from bankruptcy and said it would go all-in on EVs and buy 100,000 Teslas for its fleet by the end of 2022\. But as of October 2023, Hertz had only bought about 35,000 Teslas.

* The company also announced in 2022 that it would buy a combined 240,000 EVs from Polestar and GM over the next five years. Hertz didn’t comment on how the sell-off would affect the GM or Polestar deals.

**What happened?** Hertz claims the demand for EVs has declined, and they are much pricier to maintain and repair. Selling off the vehicles means the company is set to lose about $245 million because of depreciation tied to Tesla lowering vehicle prices.

Cutoff Patriots sweatshirts are about to become collector’s items. Bill Belichick announced yesterday that he is stepping down as New England Patriots head coach after 24 years.

Belichick had a legendary [tenure](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g4a?mblid=c4c21a2609e6&mbcid=33973766.4026052&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), which included six Super Bowl titles in nine appearances with the Pats, a record 31 postseason wins, and multiple years as the highest-paid coach in US professional sports. Between 2001 and 2019, Belichick and QB Tom Brady made magic together: The Patriots won 76% of regular season games, transforming from a struggling franchise into one of the greatest sports [dynasties](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g4b?mblid=2ac52bbfd664&mbcid=33973766.4026052&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of all time.

**But…**stars can’t shine forever. Belichick finished the 2023 season with a 4–13 record, garnering criticism for some of his player personnel decisions. Like a startup CEO tasked with talking to investors _and_ interviewing interns in wrinkled blazers, Belichick was stretched too thin as the head coach and de facto general manager, critics said. If he coaches another team, it’s unlikely he’ll have that much autonomy again.

**It was apparently the week to call it quits:** Belichick’s former coworker Nick Saban announced he was leaving the University of Alabama after 17 seasons leading the Tide, while longtime Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll is out after 14 years in the Emerald City. All three were among the 10 highest-paid [coaches](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g4c?mblid=3b04aae02cad&mbcid=33973766.4026052&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in US sports._—CC_

**Quote:** “Refer to your app as a spatial computing app. Don’t describe your app experience as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), extended reality (XR), or mixed reality (MR).”

Apple needs the world to know that its upcoming $3.5k Vision Pro is _not_ a VR headset—it’s a “spatial computing” device. Get it right, folks. The tech giant went as far as to ~~scold~~ ask app developers to [refer to it as such](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g4g?mblid=a6b6788945c9&mbcid=33973766.4026052&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). The company doesn’t want developers calling it a headset, either. In case the new vocab was unclear, Apple used the word “spatial” 20 times in a separate Vision Pro [press release](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g4h?mblid=ff1d855ac178&mbcid=33973766.4026052&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). “The era of spatial computing has arrived,” insisted CEO Tim Cook in the release.

**Stat:** When you think of the words “High Noon,” do you imagine Gary Cooper winning a gunfight in the Wild West or frat stars guzzling alcohol at a tailgate? For many people, it’s probably the latter, as High Noon—the ready-to-drink hard seltzer brand—is now the [No. 1 spirit in the US](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g4i?mblid=90883916f6bf&mbcid=33973766.4026052&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). It sold 21.4 million cases last year, up 30% from the year before and well ahead of famous brands like Tito’s Vodka (12 million) and Jack Daniel’s (6.5 million). Alongside White Claw, High Noon helped the ready-to-drink market explode from 10 million cases sold in 2019 to 60 million last year.
