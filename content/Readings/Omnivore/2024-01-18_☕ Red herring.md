**Good morning.** The No Name Saloon is about to sling monumental amounts of buffalo burgers because the Sundance Film Festival kicks off today in Park City, UT.

Since its beginning in 1985, the festival has screened some of the most iconic movies of modern cinema, from _Boyhood_ to _Queens Boulevard_. But what were the best Sundance movies of all time? After polling 500 filmmakers, critics, and industry members, the Sundance Institute released this list:

5\. _Memento_

4\. _Little Miss Sunshine_

3\. _Get Out_

2\. _Reservoir Dogs_

1\. _Whiplash_

They get it right?

The Supreme Court heard a pair of cases yesterday that could weaken the power of federal agencies to regulate any industry, from crypto to pharmaceuticals, so you’d never guess that they’re about...fishing.

Lawyers for Atlantic herring fishermen in the Northeast [argued against](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gfJ?mblid=696144236233&mbcid=34034853.3520075&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) a regulation requiring fishing boats to cover the \~$700/day cost of carrying government-mandated conservation observers. While that may sound simple enough, the program is now defunct and the fishermen were already reimbursed, meaning the herrings may be…

**…a red herring.** The fishermen’s lawyers—hailing from two conservative, [Koch-backed groups](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gfK?mblid=3ac3dbfe0a25&mbcid=34034853.3520075&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)—have asked the Supreme Court to [overturn](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gfL?mblid=ed2d2e572a69&mbcid=34034853.3520075&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the precedent that made the fishing boat fee possible: a 1984 pro-regulation decision in the case Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council that’s become a cornerstone of American law.

**TL;DR on Chevron:** When a federal law is unclear, the Chevron doctrine says that judges should defer to how a federal agency with expertise in that area interprets it, as long as it’s reasonable, which gives the SEC, EPA, and basically anything starting with “Department of…” the power to determine what laws in their areas mean.

## What happens if Chevron is overturned?

It would shift the balance of power in government. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar warned the court that reversing Chevron would deal a “convulsive shock to the legal system.” It may be on its way: Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh have publicly criticized Chevron for giving what Gorsuch called “huge amounts” of power to bureaucrats.

If the court rules in favor of the fishermen, then the hundreds of federal agencies that set rules for public health, workplace safety, consumer protections, and more would be severely limited in their ability to decide what Congress means when it writes a law.

**This could spell trouble for evolving industries.** Finance and trade regulators who try to keep crypto and AI in check, for example, primarily work off of old laws written before a lot of our current tech existed, which is where their ability to interpret comes in clutch. Without the Chevron doctrine, the way laws apply would largely be left up to the courts_—_where getting clarification tends to be costly and time consuming._—ML_

The Chinese government, like your aging relatives, wants to see more baby showers. China’s overall population [dropped](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gfT?mblid=3a5a1ef0c395&mbcid=34034853.3520075&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in 2023 for the second year in a row due in part to an annual decline in babies being born (the seventh straight one), the country announced yesterday.

China’s population fell by 2.1 million to 1.4 billion last year, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics. The fall was partially driven by a Covid surge that pushed the death rate up 6.6% to 11.1 million people last year, outpacing the birthrate, which dipped 5.7%, to 9.02 million.

**China’s worried.** Since dropping its decadeslong one-child rule in 2016, the country has done a hard 180 on its messaging. Even President Xi Jinping has encouraged young women to have kids. But…

* Young people cite rising housing and education costs as reasons they’re still child-free.
* Some women, specifically, are opting out of marriage and motherhood, saying the legal system isn’t set up to protect their property, financial freedom, or personal safety.

## It’s so cold, even EVs are giving up

While you were asking your mom if she’s seen your old snow pants, electric vehicle owners have struggled to get around town during the polar vortex.

In Chicago, where the wind chill fell as low as –25 degrees Fahrenheit this week, Tesla owners had so much trouble simply charging their vehicles that some people were forced to abandon their dead cars, creating charging stations that became known as “[Tesla graveyards](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gf-?mblid=67e8c0fb916e&mbcid=34034853.3520075&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).” Drivers [reported](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gf%5F?mblid=feaf2efa7798&mbcid=34034853.3520075&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) sitting in queues for hours to juice up their EVs—and spending even more hours [waiting](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gg0?mblid=bfbec2c416d3&mbcid=34034853.3520075&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for their Teslas to finish charging once plugged in, since the process takes longer in lower temps.

**Why?** Like the Miami Dolphins, EVs don’t handle the cold very well. To be fair, gas-powered cars don’t, either, but the effects are often more noticeable with EVs because you can’t just fill ’em up. Freezing temps can cut EV battery life by as much as half, according to AAA. Blasting the heat also drains the battery.

**Meanwhile…**in Norway, where 1-in-4 cars is electric and winter temps stay below freezing, this _isn’t_ a problem. That’s because the Scandinavians are [prepared for it](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gg1?mblid=97e5cf2af9ef&mbcid=34034853.3520075&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a): Norway has better charging infrastructure, and drivers are generally better at “preconditioning,” or warming up, their cars before a charge, which makes the process more efficient.

**And don’t get us started on Cybertrucks.** Not only do they need to be charged, but Tesla’s new EV pickup trucks also keep getting [stuck in the snow](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gg3?mblid=ecd530c045af&mbcid=34034853.3520075&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)._—CC_

**Stat:** An outdated definition of “out of pocket” isn’t the only thing boomers are holding onto: [Data](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gg7?mblid=23eedbaa99c1&mbcid=34034853.3520075&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) compiled by Redfin shows that boomer empty-nesters own 28% of the large homes in the US, while millennials with kids own just 14% (Gen Z parents barely make a blip with 0.3%). That’s true even though millennials make up a larger share of the adult population than boomers do, and it’s a change from 10 years ago, when young families and parents whose kids had flown the coop were about as likely to own large homes. There aren’t a lot of reasons for boomers—most of whom own their homes outright—to sell, and most of the younger generations can’t afford to buy anyway.

**Quote:** “I don’t regret sharing that. I have received so many messages of people telling me, ‘I wish I would have stood up for myself the way you did.’”

Not since Brandi Glanville got booted from the _Real Housewives_ has a firing caused as much drama as the exit of ex-Cloudflare employee Brittany Pietsch, whose [video](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gg8?mblid=f45cb5655de4&mbcid=34034853.3520075&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of her termination meeting has racked up millions of views on social media. Even Cloudflare’s CEO watched it and acknowledged that the company’s actions weren’t “anywhere close to perfect.” Pietsch [told](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ggq?mblid=c8d54978b8a2&mbcid=34034853.3520075&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the Wall Street Journal that she’s fine with the world watching her last moments at the job—during which she repeatedly pressed for details on what performance expectations she fell short of and asked why her manager isn’t on the call, to no avail—and that it’s led to other companies reaching out positively.

There’s no way to overstate the transformative impact the song “Breaking Free” left on Disney—and on a nation of shy teenage girls who thought they could sing. _High School Musical_’s massive success changed the way the [Disney Channel made movies](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gga?mblid=d15c0389fa1a&mbcid=34034853.3520075&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a): In addition to providing production teams with bigger budgets and more time to make movies, the Disney Channel started investing in “tentpole” films that elevated certain stars or franchises.

Michael Healy, Disney’s former SVP of Original Movies and one of the brains behind the operation, told Morning Brew, “When _High School Musical_ came out, I said to people out loud, ‘This is the kind of success that could get you fired.’” 

We talked to 16 people who were there, and from it we created an oral history of the Disney Channel Original Movie. Read more [here](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gga?mblid=63273fe904a1&mbcid=34034853.3520075&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).
