Hello there! üëã I'm Reza, the creator of Magic Shortcut. I'm thrilled to introduce Magic Shortcut, a productivity tool designed to streamline your workflow by enabling you to create programmable keyboard shortcuts. As a software engineer, I frequently work with code snippets to streamline my coding process and save time by eliminating repetitive typing. However, I noticed that this functionality is limited to code editors. I envisioned something even more powerful‚Äîan all-encompassing snippet tool that not only works across all applications but also offers additional functionalities beyond simple snippet actions. That's why I decided to develop my own solution, a versatile shortcut tool that seamlessly integrates with any application. At first, I created this tool for my own use. However, as I experienced its benefits, I realized it could also benefit others. That's why I developed it into a dedicated app, added more features, and polished it to create Magic Shortcut. Magic Shortcut offers support for five types of shortcuts: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Plain text ‚Üí Simple text expander 2Ô∏è‚É£ Formatted text ‚Üí Rich text format text/document (MS Word) 3Ô∏è‚É£ Code snippet ‚Üí Multi-platform code snippets 4Ô∏è‚É£ Python script ‚Üí Execute python script 5Ô∏è‚É£ Shell command ‚Üí Run CMD command Magic Shortcut is free to use and operates entirely offline, no data or information is collected from you. Your privacy and security are maintained, with your information kept private and secure. Magic Shortcut is currently in beta, and I highly value any feedback you can provide to help me improve Magic Shortcut. Your input is invaluable.
