# Full Content: 

 Hello,

 I'm a long time Windows user. While I used Unix-based OS a few times (Solaris at university, OSMC on my raspberryPi, Ubuntu VM for uni projects), I mostly develop on Windows. However recently I'm starting to learn Rust, while it is possible to develop with Rust on Windows it is recommended to use a Unix OS.

 With that in mind I'm hesitating between two options to code in Rust. Either I go for a dual boot Ubuntu OS, so I have a "complete" and isolated setup environment, but it takes more time to configure before using and I've read that dual booting Windows + Linux can be a headache. Or I'm using WSL2, I develop on Windows and build/compile on the WSL2 bash, easier to setup (I already have WSL2 installed with ubuntu), but I fear it quickly become a nightmare when I'll try to debug, test, etc the code. Like I'll deploy using the Linux sub-system but most likely I'll need Windows GUI, or some interaction between the two to test.

 Any experience regarding one method or both when developing softwares ?

 Thanks !

 EDIT : thank you everyone, WSL2 it is, thanks for your experience feedback and your explanations.
