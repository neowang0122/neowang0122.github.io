# Full Content: 

Our curriculum is built on a core of four (4) technical courses. But unlike many other schools, you select these from a roster of core courses, choosing those that will best prepare you for your individual goals. A required one credit-hour course in professional development and practice helps to prepare you for the workplace. For electives, you can choose from courses within ECE, as well as hundreds of other engineering and technical courses all across campus, including business courses, that allow you to prepare for [multiple areas of specialization](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/graduate-programs/meng-program/design-your-meng-program) \- or create your own.

The centerpiece of the M.Eng. program is the [professional project](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/node/4945), in which you apply theory to a real problem, with the guidance from faculty, and often in collaboration with other students.
