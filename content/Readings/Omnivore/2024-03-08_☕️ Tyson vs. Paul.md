In Uncle Sam‚Äôs equivalent of a yearly earnings call, President Biden outlined his plans to play hardball with the corporate jet set while helping Americans who fly economy.

During a forceful State of the Union Address last night, Biden said he wants to raise the minimum tax for multinational corporations to 21%, as well as lift the corporate tax rate to 28% from the current 21%. The White House said that bumping the minimum rate will make it more difficult for pharma companies and other corporate behemoths to sidestep taxes. The president also hopes to:

* Stop letting corporations get tax deductions for all employee salaries over $1 million (the current rule applies only to C-suite pay) and make it harder for companies to write off executives‚Äô private jet travel.
* Raise the tax on corporate stock buybacks from 1% to 4% to encourage companies to spend more of their revenue on salaries and improving productivity.
* Make billionaires pay a minimum of 25% income tax.

Meanwhile, for the non-mansion dwellers, Biden unveiled a scheme to boost homeownership by [offering a $5,000 credit](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/i7G?mblid=4a4adc29371d&mbcid=34608254.3908621&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to first-time homebuyers for the first two years of their mortgage.

## The anti-Trump plan

Biden‚Äôs tax plan comes as he prepares to go full campaign mode against his predecessor and likely opponent (again), Donald Trump. The ex-president slashed corporate taxes during his White House term, but those cuts are set to expire in 2025\. Republicans want to renew all of those tax breaks, which would cost the government $3.5 trillion over a decade, per the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Trump hasn‚Äôt yet formulated a definitive tax plan of his own.

**You‚Äôll probably hear a lot more about taxes‚Ä¶**as the two candidates are expected to make their contrasting views on the issue a central part of their platforms._‚ÄîSK_

The president made the announcement during his State of the Union address last night as he draws criticism from some in his own party for not doing enough to facilitate the distribution of aid. Biden has reportedly grown frustrated with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and has sought workarounds, including airdropping the aid. The port will take weeks to build and will not require US military personnel to operate onshore, officials said.

The only thing more shocking than the experience gap between the two fighters is the 30-year age difference. Tyson, who will be 58, hasn‚Äôt fought officially since losing to Kevin McBride in 2005.

* Tyson was in a 2020 exhibition match against fellow boxing legend Roy Jones Jr. The two lasted eight rounds, but the fight ended in a draw.

* Paul is 27 and has a 9‚Äì1 record after getting into boxing four years ago, fighting mostly people who are not professional boxers. Paul‚Äôs older brother, Logan, previously fought Floyd Mayweather Jr. in an exhibition bout.

**Big picture:** The match is part of Netflix‚Äôs plans to become your go-to streaming platform for live niche sports entertainment (emphasis on _entertainment_).

An electric vehicle startup is spinning its wheels in mud after botching its response to a viral tech reviewer‚Äôs criticism of its new car.

**ICYMI:** Popular consumer gadgets YouTuber Marques Brownlee (aka [MKBHD](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/i7w?mblid=4210b4b29327&mbcid=34608254.3908621&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)) tore down the EV-maker Fisker‚Äôs new Ocean SUV in a video titled ‚Äú[This is the Worst Car I‚Äôve Ever Reviewed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/i7x?mblid=123721656c29&mbcid=34608254.3908621&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).‚Äù It‚Äôs gotten 4.3+ million views since going up less than three weeks ago.

Rage, Voyager 1, rage against the dying of the light. The little space probe that could, which launched in 1977 to explore the cosmos, may have [gone dark](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/i76?mblid=89af0f6031ab&mbcid=34608254.3908621&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), NASA said. The craft, now 15 billion miles into space, is sending incoherent data back to Earth, and researchers can‚Äôt figure out why. Mission project manager Suzanne Dodd said it‚Äôs the ‚Äúmost serious issue‚Äù she‚Äôs seen. If it really is Voyager 1‚Äôs time to go gentle into that good night, it‚Äôll have earned it: The probe has made countless contributions to our understanding of space, but perhaps none as profound as the ‚ÄúPale Blue Dot,‚Äù pictured above, a legendary photograph of our home planet taken by Voyager 1 from 3.7 billion miles away. Even when Voyager 1 ceases to operate, it will continue to journey further and further into places unknown, likely outliving humanity itself.

**Stat:** Gum chewin‚Äô just ain‚Äôt what it used to be. US gum sales rose [less than 1%](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/i77?mblid=90779905aeb4&mbcid=34608254.3908621&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) last year, down 32% from 2018\. Meanwhile, global sales rose 5% to $16 billion, but still down 10% from 2018\. Covid is mostly to blame: At the height of mask-wearing and social distancing, no one was worried much about bad breath. People also weren‚Äôt getting out of the house as often to make impulse gum purchases at the cash register. The Great Gum Slump is bad enough that some manufacturers, like Mondelez International, have gotten out of the business entirely.
