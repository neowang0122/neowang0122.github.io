Millions of Americans dreading the post-pandemic re-up of federal student loan payments in October could find relief in a new program [launched](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7J?mblid=32541a36d83d&mbcid=32252485.4284952&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) yesterday by the Department of Education—if it can survive likely legal challenges.

Applications are [open](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7K?mblid=0a795a11c3d4&mbcid=32252485.4284952&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for the SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education) Plan, an income-driven repayment option that will replace the popular REPAYE (Revised Pay As You Earn Repayment) Plan. President Biden hopes it will help out the federal borrowers impacted when the Supreme Court [struck down](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/91V?mblid=e60a8431d071&mbcid=32252485.4284952&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) his more ambitious student loan forgiveness program in June.

Beginning this fall under the SAVE Plan…

* One million more Americans will qualify for $0 monthly payments, the Department of Education estimates. The SAVE Plan raises the income threshold for paying nothing to $32,805, up from $22,000 or less under current income-driven repayment programs.
* Unpaid interest will not pile up as long as people make their monthly payments, even if that monthly payment gets cut to $0.

And, beginning in July 2024…

* Loans of $12,000 or less will be canceled after 10 years of payments (including loans taken out before 2024). Every additional $1,000 borrowed beyond that would extend cancellation by another year, so a $22,000 loan would get canceled after 20 years of payments.
* Undergraduate loan payments will be capped at 5% of borrowers’ discretionary funds—total income minus $32,800—down from 10% under current programs.

**Potential legal attack inbound:** The SAVE Plan is estimated to cost between $138 ==billion== and $361 billion over 10 years, but first, it might get hit with the kinds of lawsuits that [sank](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7L?mblid=cb6888604d07&mbcid=32252485.4284952&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) Biden’s $400 billion loan forgiveness program. More than 60 Republican lawmakers tried to push the Education Secretary to withdraw the new repayment plan, and the program’s opponents say legal challenges are likely on the way. But, according to administration officials, similar income-based loan programs already exist, and they have _not_ been successfully challenged._—ML_

A net 51% of banks said they’d raised their standards for large- and medium-sized business loans last quarter, up from 46% during Q1 and the highest since 2008 (not counting the pandemic). For consumer loans, more banks than last quarter said they had upped credit card loan standards, but not as many banks tightened auto loan standards. Banks expect standards to keep getting stricter, with most reporting they’ll continue to raise the bar across loan categories.

The first built-from-scratch nuclear reactor to get turned on in the US in decades is supplying electricity to Georgia, Florida, and Alabama, with capacity to power up to 500,000 homes and businesses.

The new reactor is part of a larger expansion at Vogtle, which already had two operational reactors and will add a fourth one by next spring...if everything goes according to plan. But things haven’t so far: The new reactor went live seven years later than planned, and costs ballooned from $14 billion to nearly $35 billion.

Wearing the chunkiest, ugliest shoes has always been in fashion for some. But now it’s clog girl summer, and Birkenstock is bracing for a possible September IPO that would [value](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/a7i?mblid=418a1f4a002e&mbcid=32252485.4284952&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the company anywhere from $8 billion to $10 billion, according to Bloomberg.

**Birks have always been lurking.** The German sandal has enjoyed several waves of popularity since it first arrived in the US in the ’60s, including in the 90s and 2000s when the brand proved it wasn’t just for Deadheads as mega celebrities wore them. And just like other perfectly horrendous footwear options (Crocs just reported a record $1 billion of revenue for the second quarter and is valued at \~$6.7 billion), Birks are back.

* Birkenstock’s revenue jumped about 29% to $1.3 billion last year.
* Celebs like Kendall Jenner are rocking Birks this summer, and the sandal even made it in a couple of scenes of the new _Barbie_ movie, which Bloomberg reports helped boost recent sales.

It’s by design: Two years ago, Birkenstock was acquired in a deal that valued the company at roughly $4.9 billion by L. Catterton, the private equity firm backed by LVMH, the luxury conglomerate that keeps Bernard Arnault constantly trading spots with Elon Musk on the list of richest people in the world. Since the acquisition, the brand has collabed with high-end designers like Dior and Manolo Blahnik.
