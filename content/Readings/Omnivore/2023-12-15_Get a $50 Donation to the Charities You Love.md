This holiday season, I'm joining with a great group of charitable friends to give you the gift of a donation to the charity of your choice.

I'm excited to announce—along with my great partners Arianna Huffington, Jay Shetty, Jewel, Kevin Systrom, Dr. Mehmet Oz, and Paul Tudor Jones—that 20,000 **free $50 TisBest charity gift cards are now available** for people to donate to the charity of their choice, no strings attached. The gift of a donation to someone's favorite charity gets money to those who need it most, eliminates wasteful giving, makes holiday shopping super easy, and spreads true holiday spirit. My hope is simply that you will experience the joy of receiving a charitable gift rather than a traditional one, and you might consider giving charitable gifts to your friends, families, and colleagues.

You can claim a card now using the link below while they last.

 This way of gifting will fill you with the holiday spirit, and I hope that you will pass this idea along to others who you think would appreciate it.
