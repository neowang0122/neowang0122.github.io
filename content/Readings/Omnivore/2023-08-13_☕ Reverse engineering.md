_Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even improve your memory while you sleep._

![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/18x0,spzWk2Mex8IUmUJwKapj8HAM6es3PlnyoD6wE4JU6eds/https://em-content.zobj.net/thumbs/120/apple/237/nose_1f443.png) **Sleep smells boost memory.** If you’ve ever teased someone for using an oil diffuser at night, they will not forget it. New research has found an overwhelmingly positive correlation between cognitive performance and [sniffing](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aC7?mblid=6f0c92b37277&mbcid=32374526.4293074&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) full-strength natural oils while sleeping. In a trial, adults between 60 and 85 turned on a diffuser before bedtime and slept with any natural oil scent for two hours per night for six months. They performed 226% better on a memory test than those in the control group, according to the study out of the University of California, Irvine. The researchers say their findings mean that smell therapies, which are sometimes used with dementia patients, could be deployed overnight instead of taking up waking hours.

By analyzing tweets from more than 20,000 Twitter users who contributed to Wikipedia, researchers found an increase in positive-emotion language up to an hour before [donations](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aC8?mblid=9cfde17f6be0&mbcid=32374526.4293074&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) took place, followed by a return to neutral happiness levels. But they also say their findings are limited by only assessing tweets. Some happy donors might just be more likely to post about their charity work online, whereas other donors (who might feel happy or sad or neither) might keep it to themselves.

The first square watermelon was grown in 1975 in Zentsuji, Japan, simply by putting a budding melon in a transparent box—no special seeds required. And because the fruits grow into whatever shape they’re forced into, triangular and heart-shaped watermelons can also be found in Japan. But before you drop up to $800 to get one shipped to your kitchen counter, you should know they’re practically inedible. Square watermelons are picked before they’re ripe in order to last as prized display items for longer, so you wouldn’t enjoy eating the expensive status symbols (though that didn’t stop [this guy](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aCa?mblid=efbd3155deb9&mbcid=32374526.4293074&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)).—_ML_

## [How to harness pollution to fight climate change](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az-?mbcid=32374526.4293074&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) 

[ ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az-?mbcid=32374526.4293074&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)_Felix Cesare/Getty Images_

Cargo ships spewing plumes of sulfuric smoke sounds like something worthy of an indignant “How dare you?” from Greta Thunberg.

But this type of pollution might actually have been slowing climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Sulfur-spitting ships leave a cloud trail that can function as a jumbo beach umbrella, temporarily keeping the ocean waters cool by reflecting sunlight.

**How do we know?** As science vlogger Hank Green recently [spotlighted](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az%5F?mblid=3413e804d3fe&mbcid=32374526.4293074&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), we’ve all been involved in a massive, accidental experiment in geoengineering—the controversial concept of altering the Earth’s environment to curb climate change—and we didn’t even know it.

In 2020, a new UN rule for fuels that the shipping industry could use took effect, and ships now belch out over 80% less sulfur. While reducing emissions of a chemical that’s harmful to human health is a win for everyone, it’s also become an unintended field test demonstrating how chemical clouds could be used to keep the Earth from overheating.

* Some scientists believe the new absence of these clouds partially caused this year’s record-breaking summer temps in the Atlantic Ocean.
* Although other factors like El Niño and the eruption of an underwater volcano in the Pacific Ocean last year likely played a role, the reduction of sulfur dioxide clouds is believed to be one of the reasons oceans have been so hot, causing record temperatures on land.

While the human-caused phenomenon is unintentional, some experts have long considered making reflective clouds deliberately (or boosting existing ones) to stave off global warming—even though the planet-scale risks of this approach keep it from becoming most scientists’ Plan A for climate change.

## The Pandora’s box of climate engineering

Sucking greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, aka carbon removal, is the least contentious geoengineering tool. Experts disagree over how well it works, but no one is worried it’ll turn our planet into an IRL environmental apocalypse film.

The same can’t be said about repelling sunrays by spraying sulfur aerosol into the stratosphere or enriching ocean clouds with sea salt to make them more reflective. Many climate scientists believe these methods are too risky since their effects aren’t entirely predictable and won’t be uniform across the planet. Others see geoengineering as a distraction from efforts to cut carbon emissions.

In a simulation run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, using sulfuric aerosols as a sun blocker made winters rainier in Scandinavia and drier in Mediterranean Europe. This would be disruptive to local agriculture and ecosystems. These disparate effects are bound to be a big sticking point in international relations, threatening to turn every UN meeting into a screaming match over who controls the “global thermostat.”

Researchers also warn that once humanity embarks on the path of artificial sunlight reflection, it might be hard to turn back— studies suggest that ceasing a geoengineering effort abruptly could cause major climate trouble.

## Not all experiments are accidents

Some private companies have undertaken small-scale efforts to test sun ray-reflecting technologies.

One researcher from the UK teamed up with a space startup, European Astrotech, to test a system called “stratospheric aerosol transport and nucleation” (the acronym probably isn’t the best for a controversial emerging tech: SATAN). With a $1,000 balloon system, it achieved what might’ve been the first successful delivery of sun-blocking aerosols to the stratosphere, according to unpublicized reporting obtained by the MIT Technology Review.

Though the experiment was properly permitted and released just 400 grams of sulfur, scientists opposed to these efforts are unsettled by the fact that someone with a bit of cash and a startup partner is testing tech that could change the weather with minimal oversight.

It’s now not a matter of if but when geoengineering happens, climate economist and geoengineering research proponent Gernot Wagner told Morning Brew. He thinks scientists should investigate potential effects now so that the world isn’t blindsided when some nation decides to plow ahead with it.

**The government is taking geoengineering seriously…**the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy recently released a report outlining what research could be done to evaluate the risks and benefits of the technology._—SK_

## [Place to be: The Iowa State Fair](#) 

_Scott Olson/Getty Images_

_It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process._

Opened August 10 and running through next weekend, the sprawling Iowa State Fair is an annual celebration of agriculture, American democracy, and fried foods on a stick.

While every state thinks its late-summer fair is the best, Iowa’s (est. 1854) stands out from the pack. Here’s why.

**Creative competitions:**

* The state fair’s [husband calling contest](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aAb?mblid=e9c2fd0bba90&mbcid=32374526.4293074&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) goes viral every few months, and it is personally one of my favorite videos ever.
* The [Mr. Legs contest](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aAc?mblid=f8acb0dc424b&mbcid=32374526.4293074&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) awards the man at the fair who’s got the best legs.
* Bagging groceries becomes a full-contact sport in a competition that judges contestants based on speed, proper item arrangement, and weight distribution among bags (underrated skill).
* And you can’t miss the [butter cow](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aAd?mblid=486a766622dc&mbcid=32374526.4293074&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

**Creative food:** Do _not_ come to the Iowa State Fair if you prefer eating with utensils, because here, any food you can imagine—hard-boiled eggs, pickles, edible cookie dough, deep-fried strawberry shortcake—comes served on a stick. No matter what freshly impaled foods you try, you should always save room for the pork chop on a stick, ranked the [No. 1 Iowa State Fair dish](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aAe?mblid=888cca563aca&mbcid=32374526.4293074&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) by Des Moines Register readers. Checks out: Iowa is the top US state for pork production.

**Politics:** You might think wandering around a fairground would help you avoid the political news cycle, but at the Iowa State Fair, there’s no escape. Because of Iowa’s traditional role as the first state to vote in presidential primaries, candidates head to the fair the year before an election to schmooze with voters. Though Democrats booted their Iowa caucuses to later in the calendar this year, the state is still up first for Republicans in January. This year, 13 presidential candidates are scheduled to hit the fair’s Soapbox stage.—_NF_

## [Crowd work](#) 

Last week we asked: How would you know that you’ve mastered a language?

Here are some of our favorite responses.

* “I knew I’d reached a French milestone when I could understand my neighbor’s hallway fights with her boyfriend.”—_Elizabeth from Washington, DC_
* “When you get pulled over for a traffic violation and you can nervously stammer your way out of it in the local tongue.”—_Mark from Houston, TX_
* “When you smash your foot into something, and the resulting profanity that follows is not in English.”—_Josh from Shenzhen, China_
