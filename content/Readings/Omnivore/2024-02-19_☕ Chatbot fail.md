**Good morning.** No one thought Jimmy Carter would be around to celebrate this Presidents Day, with yesterday marking one year since the 99-year-old former commander-in-chief entered hospice care.

Carter’s remarkable longevity makes him among the 6% of patients who enter hospice care to remain alive one year later. But hospice and palliative care professionals say they’re not surprised. They hope Carter’s story [raises awareness](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hsB?mblid=7b71894db194&mbcid=34394403.3919667&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) about the benefits of accessing hospice earlier and its focus on pain management, comfort, and quality of life.

Happy Presidents Day to Jimmy and everyone else.

Last week, the AI chips giant surpassed Amazon and Alphabet to become the third most valuable company in the US behind Apple and Microsoft. As for the markets overall, the three major indexes lost ground last week following hotter than expected inflation reports. They can’t fall anymore today, though, because the stock market is closed for Presidents Day.

As additional military aid for Ukraine stalls in Congress and the death of Putin’s No. 1 critic Alexei Navalny has jacked up the urgency to confront Russia, supporters of arming Ukraine are using a new persuasive tactic: They argue that helping Ukraine is a major benefit to the American economy.

At the Munich Security Conference, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told Bloomberg that plugging Ukraine with weapons would lead to [more business](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hsD?mblid=e2c51af5357d&mbcid=34394403.3919667&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for US defense contractors and preserve a lucrative US–Europe trading relationship that’s threatened by Putin’s aggression. And last week, President Biden’s top economic adviser Lael Brainard [stressed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hsE?mblid=a38482257645&mbcid=34394403.3919667&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) “how important \[Ukraine\] funding is for employment and production around the country.”

## Branding it as “investment,” not “aid”

Of the $61 billion earmarked for Ukraine, 64% would flow back to US defense contractors that make the weapons, the Biden administration said. Indeed, since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly two years ago, industrial production in the US defense and space sector has surged 17.5%, per the Fed.

That’s a reflection of orders not just from the Pentagon, but also from European governments buying new military hardware and replenishing inventory they’ve sent to Ukraine.

* Poland ordered $30 billion worth of Apache helicopters, M1A1 Abrams tanks, and other equipment.
* Germany is buying 35 F-35A Lightning jets from Lockheed Martin and 60 Chinook helicopters from Boeing in deals worth nearly $20 billion.

In terms of European purchases from US defense companies, “The past few years are equal to the prior 20 years,” military industry analyst Myles Walton told the WSJ. Military spending by Europeans has come under attack by GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, who said he’d encourage Russia to invade NATO countries that don’t spend enough on defense.

**Big picture:** It’s unclear whether these economic arguments will move House Speaker Mike Johnson to [take up](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hsF?mblid=669942746ebf&mbcid=34394403.3919667&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the foreign aid bill, which has passed the Senate but faces opposition from some Trump-allied House members who are skeptical of sending more funds to Ukraine. Nothing will happen for the next two weeks, because lawmakers have left town for winter break.—_NF_

At a sneaker convention in Philadelphia on Saturday, the former president unveiled a [new sneaker line](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hsJ?mblid=3f55ddde1fcc&mbcid=34394403.3919667&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), “Never Surrender High-Tops,” one day after a judge ordered Trump to pay $355 million in a civil fraud case and three weeks after another judge ordered him to pay E. Jean Carroll $83 million in a defamation case. The gold sneakers adorned with a US flag went quickly—all 1,000 pairs priced at $399 apiece sold out in hours.

US natural gas production reached its highest point in history in December, hitting 105.5 billion cubic feet a day in the Lower 48 states. Meanwhile, Americans haven’t felt the need to crank up the heat given the mildest winter since reliable records began in the 1950s. Surging supply and minimal demand have caused natural gas prices to plummet 50% in just one month.

The widely panned Dakota Johnson/Sydney Sweeney vehicle made just $25.8 million at the domestic box office in its debut, the worst-ever opening for a Sony superhero movie and a major financial boondoggle, given its reported budget between $80 million and $115 million. To put the numbers into context, the universally mocked Sony project _Morbius_ managed to make $39 million during its opening weekend in April 2022\. _Madame Web_’s poor showing can’t be blamed on a slow overall weekend, since the Bob Marley biopic _One Love_ amassed $33.2 million and has earned $51 million since it was released on Valentine’s Day.

In 2022, Jake Moffat asked a chatbot for help booking a last-minute flight to attend his grandmother’s funeral. The chatbot told Moffat to book the flight and request a refund within 90 days. However, Air Canada denied his \~$450 refund, saying bereavement abatements cannot be applied retroactively.

Air Canada initially offered Moffat a $200 coupon and promised to update the chatbot, but Moffat decided to take the airline to a civil tribunal. The airline’s [arguments](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hsQ?mblid=1a51f519ebc6&mbcid=34394403.3919667&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) included:

* The chatbot was a separate legal entity “responsible for its own actions.”
* Moffat should not have trusted the chatbot and should have double-checked the info.

One tribunal member called the arguments “remarkable,” which sounds like the polite Canadian way of saying “ridiculous.”

**Call them r Canada because they’ve dropped the Ai.** After the ruling, the airline appears to have removed chatbot services from its website. Finally, a robot that lost its job to a human._—DL_

The Odysseus lunar lander from Houston-based Intuitive Machines had a successful launch last Thursday and is [on its way](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hsU?mblid=c359eec30029&mbcid=34394403.3919667&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to the south polar region of the moon in an attempt to find water.

Nvidia will also try to keep its historic hot streak going when it reports on Wednesday—expectations are through the roof.

**Conservatives will rally around Trump at CPAC.** Donald Trump, Argentinian President Javier Milei, and South Dakota Gov.
