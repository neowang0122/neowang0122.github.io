_Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even see more clearly._

ü´ò **Coffee beans make concrete stronger.** Researchers looking to minimize food waste found inspiration‚Äîand then construction materials‚Äîin their morning brew. A team of Australian scientists has produced concrete that is about 30% stronger by replacing 15% of the mixture‚Äôs sand with [charred coffee grounds](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9b?mblid=d48888d0edf4&mbcid=32519613.4264071&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). Australia produces enough concrete that researchers say all 75,000 metric tons of the country‚Äôs annual coffee waste could be repurposed as a partial sand substitute, which would help the environment and reduce the construction industry‚Äôs demand for natural resources. The researchers are already working with local governments on future infrastructure projects.

Poor eye health has been a big problem for the island country, where around 90% of high schoolers have already developed [blurry vision](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9c?mblid=3062cea73f61&mbcid=32519613.4264071&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)‚Äîcompared to just 50% of all age groups in Europe and the US. But in the few years since Taiwan launched a program to get young school children outside for two hours each day, myopia rates among primary school kids steadily declined from a peak of 50% to 46.1%.

An Oxford study of genetic data from 30,000 relatives stored in the UK Biobank has found a genetic trait that makes people more likely to accept an invitation to join a research study. It‚Äôs correlated but distinct from educational attainment, BMI, and other traits. One researcher said this is a ‚Äúhuge step‚Äù toward eliminating ascertainment bias (similar to sampling bias) from genetic research, which would make study outcomes more accurate and representative of target populations._‚ÄîML_

## [Why is a ship snooping on an offshore wind farm?](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9e?mbcid=32519613.4264071&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) 

[ ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9e?mbcid=32519613.4264071&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)_Matthew J. Lee/The Boston Globe via Getty Images_

Must-haves for a ship setting sail from Miami to New York: Ocean trip playlist, life jackets, and an American flag on its mast. But Old Glory is the most vital checklist item, since the voyage would be illegal without it. US law forbids foreign vessels from transporting goods between American ports.

The 1920 Jones Act requires that cargo ships undertaking domestic trips be made and registered in America and owned and crewed by Americans. And while an obscure maritime restriction protecting American shipping jobs might not sound like it has much to do with your daily life, its detractors say it pushes up prices and [ruins your commute](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9f?mblid=00c80f30ade7&mbcid=32519613.4264071&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

Recently, it was accused of complicating the transition to clean energy by inhibiting the ship-heavy construction of offshore wind farms. The controversy shines a spotlight on the law‚Äôs unintended consequences.

## The offshore problem

The Vineyard Wind project, currently under construction in the waters off Massachusetts, is the first major commercial offshore wind farm in the US. And the most wonkishly named ship in history, the Jones Act Enforcer, was recently [spotted in the area](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9g?mblid=7c8103d77984&mbcid=32519613.4264071&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). Operated by an industry trade group, the ship‚Äôs crew watches over the construction to make sure that non-US ships employ American workers and otherwise comply with the Jones Act.

But not everyone appreciates it: Critics note that Vineyard Wind relies on specialized foreign vessels, and limitations on their use may be inflating costs.

The problem is that the US doesn‚Äôt have enough ships to build the wind farm, Joseph Webster of the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center told the Boston Globe. He advocates for exempting the offshore wind industry from the rule or making exemptions for boats from US-ally nations (the US has suspended the Jones Act before, after national disasters).

With government funding pouring into clean energy projects, the debate is only likely to heat up.

## How did this ‚ÄúShip American‚Äù rule become a thing?

Laws promoting ‚ÄúMade In America‚Äù ships for domestic trade are almost as old as the nation, instituted beginning with the First Congress of the United States.

The restrictions were paused during World War I but reinstated shortly after with the passage of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (aka Jones Act). Lawmakers worried that the US was too reliant on foreign ships to move goods around during the war and wanted to ensure it wouldn‚Äôt happen again.

To this day, the law‚Äôs supporters, including President Biden, tout its ability to protect American jobs in transportation and shipbuilding.

## Throwing a wrench into all things water (and beyond)

American shipbuilding has taken a nosedive over the past century‚Äîships are being made more cheaply in Asia‚Äîso the Jones Act has become a thorn in the side of many industries as fewer American-made ships are available for service.

The shortage of cheap domestic shipping options might explain why‚Ä¶

* Sending goods by sea from the US East Coast to Puerto Rico was twice as costly as shipments to neighboring Dominican Republic, per a 2012 New York Federal Reserve report.
* New England gets as much as 35% of its liquefied natural gas from abroad, despite the US being among the world‚Äôs largest exporters of LNG.

High costs for water transportation mean companies often turn to trucks instead of ships. A hypothetical Georgian farmer packing peaches on a Maine-bound truck rather than a barge might be the reason why you‚Äôre often ‚Äústuck on I-95 surrounded by smog-producing 18-wheelers,‚Äù [notes](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9f?mblid=7fd2875721f5&mbcid=32519613.4264071&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) policy analyst [Scott Lincicome](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9i?mblid=126b76893b3e&mbcid=32519613.4264071&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) at the libertarian Cato Institute.

**Looking ahead‚Ä¶**don‚Äôt expect big changes. A bill to repeal the Jones Act was introduced in 2021, but Congress never voted on it since most politicians continue to support the law._‚ÄîSK_

_It‚Äôs a big world out there. In this section, we‚Äôll teleport you to an interesting location‚Äîand hopefully give you travel ideas in the process._

Are you feeling lochy?

If so, you might want to book a last-minute flight to the Scottish Highlands, where organizers are holding what could be the [largest surface watch](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b9m?mblid=142e3380595b&mbcid=32519613.4264071&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for the Loch Ness Monster in more than 50 years.

Like Bigfoot or a better condiment than mayo, we still haven‚Äôt confirmed the existence of Nessie, the elusive sea creature whose legend dates back to the year 565, when an Irish saint was ‚Äúsaid to have driven a beast back into the water.‚Äù

Nearly two dozen sightings of the monster were reported from the 1500s to the 1800s.But the search for Nessie found a global audience in the 1930s, when a local hotel manager reported seeing a ‚Äúwhale-like fish‚Äù in Loch Ness and a subsequent photograph showing a head and neck sticking out of the water captured the attention of people around the world (that photo turned out to be a hoax).

If Nessie does live‚Äîwhich would frankly be a stretch, since she‚Äôd be at least 1,400 years old‚Äîthen this weekend‚Äôs quest will be the most high-tech effort yet to find her. Researchers plan to use drones equipped with thermal cameras to take infrared images of the water and will deploy a hydrophone that can pick up underwater sounds.

Modern science has been used before to detect whether a massive sea creature lurks in the waters of this vast lake, and the results weren‚Äôt kind to believers. In 2019, New Zealand researchers tested DNA in water samples from Loch Ness, but they only found genetic material from eels.

Still, against all common sense and available data, the search for Nessie carries on. You just _know_ that one day she‚Äôll emerge to the surface, give us a wink, and return to the impenetrable depths she‚Äôs called home for centuries.‚Äî_NF_
