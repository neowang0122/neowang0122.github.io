**Good morning.** The excitement was palpable at West Point yesterday as cadets and staff at the US Military Academy prepared to open a recently discovered lead box that was believed to be a time capsule left by students in the 1820s. Would it contain a flag? A class ring? A note of encouragement to future West Point cadets?

Nope. When two school employees opened the time capsule in front of a packed auditorium, all they found was…mud.

PSA to everyone at West Point: The next time you attempt to pry open a lead box that’s been buried for centuries, _please_ watch a single horror movie first. Y’all just released a demon.

Hawaiian Electric, which last week hit its lowest level since 1984, jumped yesterday after it came out swinging against Maui County’s lawsuit accusing it of starting the deadly wildfires. The utility claims its downed power lines did start one fire, but that one was contained by firefighters—and that it turned off power hours before a second, uncontainable blaze began.

Some of the richest people in the world are (land)banking on a new California utopia.

The [New York Times](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bea?mblid=fed7f6ec65d6&mbcid=32538107.3742748&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) reports that several of the techiest bros have banded together to buy up $800 million worth of land in Solano County, California—just a few hours outside of the San Francisco Bay Area—with the intent to build a new city.

With Silicon Valley-area real estate constantly getting snapped up faster than you can say “vest,” Big Tech moguls have grown frustrated with the lack of housing options impacting their ability to expand their workforces. The new city, pitched as a clean-energy, public-transit-accessible, high-density urban area, is meant to combat the problem.

That explains why the land’s mystery buyers turned out to be a who’s who of tech entrepreneurship. The NYT found:

* The company making the purchases is Flannery Associates, the creation of former Goldman Sachs trader Jan Sramek.
* Investors include Sequoia Capital Chairman Michael Moritz, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon of a16z, Stripe co-founders Patrick Collison and John Collison, and Emerson Collective founder (and Steve Jobs’s widow), Laurene Powell Jobs.

## Will it be a real city or a pie in the sky?

To the list of billionaires above, this city represents the greatest opportunity since a man built a computer in his garage, relieving some of California’s massive housing shortage and creating thousands of new jobs, increased tax revenue, and infrastructure investment.

**But…**California is a notoriously difficult place to build new houses, and most of the property that Flannery bought is not zoned for residential use.

Rep. John Garamendi, who represents a district where some of the land is, told Bloomberg that Solano County’s residents would likely need to pass a rezoning initiative for the development to have a chance—and he said that’s unlikely. It probably won’t help that many residents were [sued by Flannery](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/beb?mblid=ae5a9ac04c1e&mbcid=32538107.3742748&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in 2018 for allegedly conspiring to raise land prices._—CC_

Every country has its own social activity used to spur business deals, like golf in the US and sauna in Finland, but these days in China, it’s all about “throwing eggs.”

That’s the translated name of the pokerlike card game Guandan that has [grown into a phenomenon](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/beg?mblid=2716282f97ef&mbcid=32538107.3742748&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) among Chinese business elites as the US and China become less economically entwined.

Foreign investment in China plunged to a 25-year low this spring, so Chinese dealmakers chasing yuan increasingly find themselves schmoozing with local bankers and regional government officials who dole out financial incentives to key industries—and mastering the four-person strategy game has become a reliable way to bond with them. Meanwhile, the importance of having a good Guandan face is only growing since President Biden moved to restrict US investment in Chinese AI, quantum computing, and semiconductor companies earlier this month.

But the Chinese government will probably be watching for foul play. In 2014, the country’s state media urged government officials to stop playing mahjong, claiming it facilitated corrupt deals.

**Zoom out:** The slowdown in foreign investment comes as the Chinese economy is also dealing with slumping exports, sluggish consumer spending, [record youth unemployment](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WV?mblid=5dbfcd6c7250&mbcid=32538107.3742748&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), and deep trouble in its crucial real estate sector._—SK_

Buckle your fanny pack: Airport dads are about to be even more responsible now that Google Flights is rolling out new tools for cost-conscious travelers.

PSA: Google announced yesterday that the beginning of October is projected to be the best time to book a domestic Thanksgiving or mid-December flight this year. For US → Europe trips, prices are only expected to increase with time, especially once you’re less than 72 days out.

The days of widespread near-departure price dips may be over for now, but Google Flights promises it can still help you find [cheap tickets](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bel?mblid=590a4f48fd01&mbcid=32538107.3742748&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) based on trend data with…

1. **Cheapest time to book:** Before its recent upgrade, Google Flights already labeled listed ticket prices as low, typical, or high compared to past averages, but now some listings feature a date range for when flights will cost the least.
2. **Price tracking:** Opt-in notifications alert you to price drops for specific dates or for any time in the next three-to-six months.
3. **Price guarantee:** A colorful badge appearing next to some flights means you’ll be reimbursed via Google Pay if the ticket price drops after you hit “purchase.”

**Zoom out:** These updates take aim at other airline ticket services like Kayak and Hopper, which offer similar features but charge extra for their versions of price guarantees._—ML_

Since actors walked off the job last month, more than 2,400 performers have joined or rejoined the site. And it’s not just unknowns—SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher reinstated her account this week, making herself available to spout whatever gobbledygook fans request in her distinctive nasal register for $1,500 a video.

Bloomberg reports that Google searches for the sleep-based game have already dropped by half. Still, _Pokémon Sleep_ got enough attention in its early days that one Japanese gaming site caught flak for suggesting players up their game by taking sleeping pills. Also, the game reportedly records sleepers’ [farts](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ber?mblid=22a1f2e03534&mbcid=32538107.3742748&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) (no judgment on whether that makes it more or less fun).
