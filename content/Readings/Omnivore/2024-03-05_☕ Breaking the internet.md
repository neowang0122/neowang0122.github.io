**Good morning.** You know when a character says the name of the movie _in the movie_? That’s called a “title drop,” and a [new analysis](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hZJ?mblid=d70b843b066e&mbcid=34564351.3394873&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of the phenomenon shows how common they are: 36.5% of films released from 1940 to 2023 contained at least one.

Maybe not a huge surprise, but _Barbie_ had the most title drops (267) of any movie examined over 83 years. And what about movies where the title is spoken just once? Those include _Interstellar_, _Amadeus_, _The Dark Knight_, _The Princess Bride_, and _Saving Private Ryan_.

With stats that invigorating, who needs a…morning brew?

Meanwhile, bitcoin continued its journey toward the moon, getting close to an all-time record. And it wasn’t the only cryptocurrency having a banner day: [memecoins](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h-0?mblid=4a58ec5ca537&mbcid=34564351.3394873&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) like dogecoin, pepe, and dogwifhat (yes, its image is exactly what you’re picturing) all soared.

Singaporeans struggling to send memes to their pals in Paris might have Yemen’s Houthi rebels to blame. The militant group that’s been attacking cargo ships in international waters off the coast of Yemen is now [being accused](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h-r?mblid=2e067486ae59&mbcid=34564351.3394873&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of disrupting global internet traffic.

Four underwater internet cables in the Red Sea were cut recently, Hong Kong telecoms company HGC Global Communications [said](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h-s?mblid=92fa7a7d8168&mbcid=34564351.3394873&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) yesterday.

* Just as with shipping, the Red Sea is a major passageway for the internet, with more than 15 undersea cables connecting Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.
* The cuts worsened internet connection in India, Pakistan, and East Africa, internet network analyst Doug Madory told WSJ. Though internet providers have rerouted traffic, repairs won’t begin until at least next month, and HGC said about a quarter of online data that passes through the the affected area.

While the Houthis have denied involvement and experts say a ship might’ve caused the damage, Yemen’s government-in-exile warned last month that the insurgents could target the cables. No matter the cause, the incident is a reminder that the Red Sea is what Wired once called “arguably, the internet’s most vulnerable place on Earth.”

## Internet chokepoint

A few cables may sound minor, but despite the hype around Starlink’s satellite-enabled internet, [physical subsea wires](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h-h?mblid=782505b30276&mbcid=34564351.3394873&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) still make the online world go round, as they’re the cheapest and fastest way to send data.

* Over 99% of internet traffic between continents is transmitted via hundreds of undersea cables, according to CNET.
* Tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft have been building new ones, which can cost up to $350 million a pop, per the NYT.

The Red Sea is a big part of that: It sits at the nexus of a global sea-floor cable network, with its shallow waters serving as a conduit for about 17% of global internet traffic, per Data Center Dynamics.

**Looking ahead…**the cable cuts cast a shadow over the six additional sub-Red Sea cables that internet infrastructure expert Tim Stronge told the Associated Press are currently being built to expand the network._—SK_

In a time when antitrust regulators go after Big Tech companies as regularly as _Love is Blind_ cast members break up, Apple is the one tech mammoth that’s largely escaped penalty. Regulators are making up for it now.

Yesterday, the European Commission hit Apple with a €1.8 billion ($1.95 billion) fine after concluding that the company used its dominance to restrict [music streaming competition](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hZU?mblid=57551ea7d31b&mbcid=34564351.3394873&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

European regulators determined that for a decade, Apple prevented music streaming services (read: Spotify) from telling iPhone users that they could get cheaper subscriptions outside of Apple’s App Store, which resulted in users [paying higher prices](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hZV?mblid=78decc2dd5e9&mbcid=34564351.3394873&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). The fine is the third-largest penalty ever levied by the EC against a company.

**Apple got spicy in response.** It called out Spotify—whose 2019 complaint against Apple prompted the investigation that led to the penalty—as “the primary advocate for this decision—and its biggest beneficiary,” claiming that the Sweden-based company is the one with a monopoly in the music streaming market. Apple plans to appeal the fine.

Best Buy and Macy’s are the latest major retail chains to announce that they will try to boost in-person business in the post-pandemic online shopping era by ~~livestreaming _Subway Surfers_ in every aisle~~ opening [smaller, streamlined locations](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hZM?mblid=b7b57294074b&mbcid=34564351.3394873&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

Here are the plans:

* On top of the 24 big stores Best Buy shuttered last year, the electronics chain said it will close 10 to 15 more large locations over the next fiscal year and open a number of small stores in places where it has no prior physical presence.
* Amid declining sales at department stores, Macy’s announced it will close 150 locations and, by the end of 2025, open 30 smaller ones, which will measure 30,000 to 50,000 square feet (20% of a mall Macy’s).

**Stat:** It’s not just you—coming into the office really is more of a pain than it used to be. That’s because lots of people now live twice as far from work as they did before hunkering down for the pandemic and getting used to folding laundry during camera-off Zooms. The [average distance](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h-5?mblid=82d2c390a8f8&mbcid=34564351.3394873&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) between people’s homes and their workplaces was 27 miles in 2023, up from 10 miles in 2019, the New York Times reported based on a forthcoming study by Stanford economists using data from payroll provider Gusto. In 2019, only 0.8% of people lived more than 50 miles from where they worked, but now that’s jumped to 5.5%. The shift has happened mostly among white-collar workers making more than $100,000 who are able to throw up a WFH Slack message, the study found.

Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, better known to some corners of the internet as Taylor Swift’s boyfriend’s brother, [announced](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h-6?mblid=d55d8475ea3c&mbcid=34564351.3394873&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) his retirement. The seven-time Pro Bowler spent 13 years in the NFL, all with the Philadelphia Eagles. Over the years, Kelce became as central to Philadelphia as the Liberty Bell, helping the Eagles win their first and only Super Bowl in 2018 while becoming a fan-favorite player. It seems almost certain that Kelce will be inducted into the [Hall of Fame](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h-7?mblid=2fa9f0d0919f&mbcid=34564351.3394873&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), and many expect the Eagles to retire his No. 62 jersey. We hope that in retirement, he’ll keep cheering on his brother [out the window](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h-8?mblid=27a2364a2dc7&mbcid=34564351.3394873&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of a luxury suite.
