**Good morning.** Some scientists have been watching too much _Spinal Tap_: They think hurricanes should go to Category 6.

A new study, published yesterday in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_, argues that hurricanes are getting so powerful due to climate change that the upper limit of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind scale, Category 5, is antiquated. They propose adding a Category 6 label to any tropical cyclone with sustained winds of at least 192 mph, “probably faster than most Ferraris,” lead author Michael Wehner said.

The scientists found that five storms had exceeded a hypothetical Category 6, and they’ve all occured since 2013.

One of the most important trials in the history of cryptocurrency began yesterday over the identity of a mysterious man you’ve probably never heard of. Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist, is on trial in the UK High Court over his claim that he is actually “Satoshi Nakamoto,” the [inventor of bitcoin](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gXi?mblid=2f382a9294e0&mbcid=34245395.3944556&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) and basically crypto’s version of Banksy.

**Some background:** In 2008, someone going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper that laid the groundwork for bitcoin. But, by 2011, Nakamoto—whose identity remained a secret—disappeared. It wasn’t until 2015, after years of speculation, that Craig Wright emerged as the possible man behind the curtain after Wired and Gizmodo published stories identifying him. (Two days later, Wired suggested Wright’s claim to be Nakamoto was a [hoax](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gXj?mblid=fda6459d3055&mbcid=34245395.3944556&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).)

**Many are unconvinced.** The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a group of crypto and tech funds, brought the lawsuit against Wright to prove that he is not Nakamoto and, therefore, has no claim to the technology. It hopes to stop Wright from claiming that others’ use of bitcoin software infringes on his intellectual property.

## What’s at stake?

The future of crypto. This case is a preliminary issue trial, meaning that the outcome will affect a slew of other cases involving Wright and the various bitcoin developers he’s suing, including Kraken and Coinbase.

If the court finds that Wright isn’t Nakamoto, bitcoin can continue to exist as is. But if it concludes that he _is_ Nakamoto, Wright could make it illegal for developers to use bitcoin without his approval. The threat of legal action could scare off developers and potentially send bitcoin into [obscurity](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gXk?mblid=dc567d8705f0&mbcid=34245395.3944556&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), according to experts.

**Will the real Nakamoto please stand up?** COPA alleges that the white paper Wright put forth as evidence that he’s Nakamoto is forged. Yesterday, COPA’s lawyer called Wright’s claims a “brazen lie” and alleged that he used ChatGPT to [falsify documents](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gXl?mblid=bf0371b82727&mbcid=34245395.3944556&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). Wright offered to settle last month, but COPA said no._—CC_

Reports last fall of an Israel-based McDonald’s franchisee donating meals to IDF soldiers inspired outrage. Despite McDonald’s franchisees operating independently from the corporation, the optics have hurt the company’s business in the Middle East and beyond, contributing to its posting its first quarterly sales miss in four years yesterday.

* Sales in other Muslim-majority countries like Indonesia and Malaysia were impacted, as well as in France, McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski told shareholders.
* Kempczinski called the war’s impact on local franchisees “disheartening and ill-founded.”

## It’s not just a McBoycott

Other chains are also taking the heat. Ideological clashes hurt Starbucks’s revenue not just in the Middle East but also in the US.

The coffee chain sued the Workers United union for trademark violation after a group of Starbucks employee members posted a pro-Palestine message during the first days of the war. Some activists then claimed that Starbucks supports Israel’s actions in Gaza and has sent money to the country. Starbucks said it has “no political agenda” and does not use its “profits to fund any government or military operations.”_—SK_

Prepare to feel elderly: Beginning with applicants to the class of 2029 (current high school juniors), Dartmouth will once again require prospective students to submit SAT or ACT scores, the school [announced yesterday](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gXq?mblid=58dd398d3773&mbcid=34245395.3944556&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), becoming the first Ivy and the latest top-tier school to reinstate this traditional policy.

**ICYMI:** More than 600 institutions abandoned SAT/ACT requirements during the Covid pandemic. The majority of four-year universities are still test-optional.

**But…**Dartmouth is going back to being test-mandatory after [new](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gXr?mblid=7c28737c1440&mbcid=34245395.3944556&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) [studies](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gXs?mblid=f389ed98af5a&mbcid=34245395.3944556&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) found that standardized test scores predict college performance better than high-school grades do. According to the research…

* The average college GPA for students who got a 4.0 in high school was only 0.1 points higher than for students who got a 3.2 in high school.
* Higher SAT/ACT scores have a much stronger correlation with post-college success than the high-school GPA does.
* Making the SAT/ACT optional _disadvantaged_ low-income students, who often opted to withhold scores that they thought were too low but actually could’ve gotten them admitted to Dartmouth, as the school would have considered the environmental challenges of their upbringing in assessing their scores.

**Looking ahead…**Dartmouth’s decision could influence other elite universities to follow suit.

**Stat:** Feel-good news alert: Nearly four decades after Tracy Chapman released her song “Fast Car,” the singer-songwriter is atop the music world. Following her duet with country star Luke Combs at the Grammys on Sunday night, the folk-rock ballad [reached No. 1](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gWm?mblid=32c2f8401611&mbcid=34245395.3944556&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) on the iTunes Top Songs Chart, while her 1988 self-titled debut album also rocketed to the top of its category. Combs’s 2023 version of the song has become a country hit, peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and breathing new life into Chapman’s classic. The speed at which the original “Fast Car” zoomed to the top of the charts is a reminder that, even in an age when award shows have largely lost their luster, the Grammys can still have real impact.

**Quote:** “This is the last chance saloon.”

The last chance saloon was a cool place in the 19th-century American West, but today, if you find yourself there, something has gone wrong. And for Boeing, _a lot_ has gone wrong. Amid a torrent of safety miscues at the airplane manufacturer, Emirates President Tim Clark acknowledged Boeing’s “progressive decline.” As part of the [apparent ultimatum](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gWn?mblid=d22fa05f63f9&mbcid=34245395.3944556&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), Clark added that Emirates—one of Boeing’s biggest customers—will, for the first time, send its own engineers to review its partner’s 777 production process.
