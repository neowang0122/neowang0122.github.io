**Good morning.** In October, Disney will celebrate its 100th birthday as a company. That’s pretty dang impressive—we’re six years old and have already had two hip replacements.

So, given the momentous anniversary and the extraordinary influence of Disney on global culture, we’re bringing you a summer Saturday newsletter filled with fascinating stories from Disney’s 100 years. These stories include…

* How much it costs to throw a Disney wedding
* A throwback to when Donald Duck was enlisted in the US Army
* What happens when Disney loses the exclusive rights to its characters (A Winnie the Pooh slasher film, that’s what.)
* And Disney’s surprising role in urban planning

We’ve also got our markets recap and other news links so you can still feel up-to-date on what happened in the world yesterday. Enjoy!

Semiconductor stocks dragged the index down, but investors were also a bit fidgety over an inflation report that showed producer prices grew faster than expected last month.

If you make it to 100 years old, you’ve probably learned how to power through a few rough patches.

The Walt Disney Company is experiencing one right now, as seismic shifts in technology and how people consume media force it to make some of its most dramatic moves in decades.

* Once a money printer, ESPN’s future has never been more [uncertain](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aD0?mblid=1404992542ef&mbcid=32377809.4290125&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) as people ditch cable for streaming. “While linear (television) remains highly profitable for Disney today, the trends being fueled by cord-cutting are unmistakable,” CEO Bob Iger said on Wednesday’s earnings call.
* Speaking of streaming, Disney and other new entrants have yet to make the economics work. The company announced Disney+ price hikes of up to 27% this week to squeeze more revenue out of its users. But it still does not expect its streaming business to be profitable until next year…at the earliest.

To be sure, every entertainment company is scrambling to reengineer business models as tech giants encroach on their turf and user-generated content snags eyeballs on social media platforms like TikTok. And they’re all dealing with a dual strike from Hollywood writers and actors that has frozen new content production.

But Disney also has a set of unique challenges it’s wishing would get resolved as it blows out the candles on its 100th birthday cake.

* **A fight with FL Gov. Ron DeSantis:** For decades, Disney and Florida were a dynamic duo whose private-public partnership created an economic powerhouse in central Florida. But after the company criticized DeSantis’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law, that friendship has frozen over, imperiling Disney’s growth in the state and ensnaring both parties in a nasty legal battle.
* **Succession fiascos:** CEO Bob Iger might be worse at picking a successor than Logan Roy. Here are [all the times](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aD1?mblid=468d97645bd0&mbcid=32377809.4290125&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) Iger has said he’d step down for fresh blood since assuming the position in 2005 (hint: It’s a lot). And when he finally did tap a successor in 2020, Bob Chapek, that did not go well. Iger returned to unseat Chapek just two years later and now expects to stay in the role until 2026.
* **Franchise fatigue:** Disney has ridden its Marvel and Star Wars films to remarkable box-office heights. But now it’s realizing that maybe people are bored of watching a team of superheroes raze New York City for the 25th time. Last month, Iger said Disney would pull back on making new Star Wars and Marvel content, but that leaves the question: What can replace its tired franchises as smash hits at theaters? Pixar isn’t exactly [coming up clutch](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8eL?mblid=5a192a89dd1a&mbcid=32377809.4290125&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) right now.

**Looking ahead…**as you’ll read in this newsletter, Disney has persevered through far more severe crises in its 100-year history and it may find itself in a healthier place not too far into the future.

As for the question that’s been on people’s minds for years—will Disney sell to Apple?—the [rumor mill](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aD2?mblid=4f4954ab9134&mbcid=32377809.4290125&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) started churning again recently since Iger indicated that several of Disney’s TV assets, such as ABC, were up for sale. But Iger is staying mum, saying, “It’s not something we obsess about.”—_NF_

You already live life in GO mode, so make sure you maximize every step. HOKA just dropped a brand-new sneaker that’ll have you stepping into victory no matter where the day takes you.

Introducing the [Mach X](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/axQ?lp=text1&mbadid=4810a52e0166fb68c1a45e57d7ef9bc8&mbadv=a&mblid=d12ce9d7bd39&mbcid=32377809.4290125&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), which 3 (very lucky) Morning Brew team members gave a spin during the Brooklyn Mile earlier this month. Let’s just say: These kicks came to win.

The [Mach X is a high-speed plated road shoe](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/axQ?lp=text2&mbadid=4810a52e0166fb68c1a45e57d7ef9bc8&mbadv=a&mblid=818ba9d47457&mbcid=32377809.4290125&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that’s been refined through meticulous, cutting-edge testing. It’s designed to deliver serious speed and comfy enough for more casual runners.

Oh, and they’re stabilized through the midsole’s Pebax® propulsion plate that’s paired with advanced foam compounds. Stability + speed = the perfect running shoe.

[Add some winners to your sneaker lineup](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/axQ?lp=text3&mbadid=4810a52e0166fb68c1a45e57d7ef9bc8&mbadv=a&mblid=f28e11893c05&mbcid=32377809.4290125&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

Disney likes to keep its image as clean as Cinderella’s stepmom wants her floors, so it’s notoriously difficult to use the company’s likeness without hearing from lawyers.

But in the US, copyrights only last 95 years on stuff made a long time ago. After that, the material, or intellectual property, falls into the public domain, meaning anyone can use it however they’d like. That’s why, before the company’s 100th birthday this October, we’ve started seeing NSFW depictions of classic Disney characters.

The prime example is _Winnie the Pooh:_ _Blood and Honey_,a gory [slasher film](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aD3?mblid=ff20400f185a&mbcid=32377809.4290125&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) released in February after Winnie and his original storybook pals became free to use.

And a much bigger prize is coming next year for people hoping to flip Disney’s image on its head. _Steamboat Willie_, the 1928 short film which features the earliest version of Mickey (and Minnie), will enter the public domain on January 1, 2024.

**But…**Disney has another trick up its sleeve that could rein in anyone looking to make a twisted Mickey movie: trademarks. So, we asked an expert on intellectual property law what it would take to get a mouse slasher on the big screen. You can see what he had to say [here](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aD4?mblid=08ec876fe022&mbcid=32377809.4290125&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)._—ML_

Donald Duck gets drafted, while Mickey Mouse scours the sky for enemy planes. This isn’t some militaristic fever dream…it’s typical Disney content from World War II.

During the global conflict, Disney channeled its creative juices to produce Uncle Sam-sponsored war propaganda to aid the country in defeating Nazism. The government contracts allowed the entertainment juggernaut to stay afloat in a trying time for its business. The studio tapped its iconic animated characters to implore the American public to buy war bonds, pay taxes, and partake in the war effort.

The result is pragmatism combined with some good old-fashioned fun: The wartime cartoons and print media are infused with patriotic PSAs while staying true to the brand’s comedic quirkiness, making for prime propaganda-tainment. Ultimately, they helped keep the company out of bankruptcy and raised audiences’ spirits during some of history’s darkest hours.

If you want to approach planning your wedding in an emotionless, just-the-numbers way, Disney’s wedding brochure is the worst place you can start. The official division that plans and executes magical nuptials on the company’s properties, Disney’s Fairy Tale Weddings & Honeymoons, kicks off its downloadable brochure by telling couples, “This is more than just a wedding. It’s your fairytale powered by Disney.”

It shouldn’t be surprising that the entertainment conglomerate that owns most of our childhood memories would also slather on the storytelling to dominate the big adult day. Over 50,000 couples said “I do” in front of oversized duck characters between 1991 and 2018.

And, no matter how many times the internet [freaks out](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aDr?mblid=0e707711900b&mbcid=32377809.4290125&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) about Disney Adults allegedly opting for $5,500 Minnie and Mickey appearances over food for guests, couples will still spend thousands to say exchange vows at the mouse’s house.

Last year, Disney announced a new real estate venture, Storyliving by Disney, a set of planned communities across the US that will “bring the magic of Disney to people wherever they are,” according to Chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products Josh D’Amaro. The first will be Cotino in Rancho Mirage, California, which is expected to feature restaurants and stores as well as programming and experiences in line with the Disney brand.

Disney’s latest real estate ambitions might seem out of the scope of a company that makes cartoons, but planned developments and self-governing districts are as much a part of Disney’s DNA as frogs asking for a kiss.

Building cities was a goal of Walt Disney’s from the very beginning, as the creation of EPCOT (the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow) shows. Walt died before fulfilling his vision for a community of tomorrow, but Disney’s aspirations continued without him.
