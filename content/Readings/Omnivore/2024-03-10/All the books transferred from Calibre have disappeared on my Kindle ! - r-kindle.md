 Help !

==My kindle library only shows the books I've bought directly from the kindle store on my kindle, but none of the books I've transferred from Calibre.== 

 This is weird because the books are still in the memory of my kindle when I look it up in finder on mac (in kindle/documents).

==This happened yesterday when I put it on wifi mode for the first time in a month.== It also did this weird thing where it bought a book by accident, and I had to go in my order summary on amazon to cancel it . Maybe this is linked ?

 Anyway, this is terrible because I really need my original files of those books just as they were on my kindle : I read multiple books at a time, and highlight all the important parts so that I can remember the story correctly when I come back to a book I haven't read in a while. This is especially important for series : I sometimes will have a break in a series of 10 books, and it's always been extremely useful to be able to read the important parts of a book I read a while ago before starting the new book in a series. This feature is the MAIN reason I got a Kindle. I have the real copy of all the books I read, and the kindle copy for this very useful reason.

 Now I feel really lost as what to do, and how to get back all those books with my personal highlights, bookmarks, and reading placement.

 Can somebody help ?
