 HOW TO REMEMBER ANYTHING FOREVER-ISH

 play/read time: 20 minutes

 by nicky case · oct 2018  

 In Greek mythology, Mnemosyne, the goddess of Memory...  ...was the mother of the Muses, the goddesses of inspiration.  music  theatre  weird fanfic  So, how's Memory and Inspiration doing in schools?  bla  bla  bla  bla  bla  bla  bla  bla  Yeah.  Not only are common practices like lectures, cramming, and re-reading _boring_, science has shown they _don't even work well_.\*  \* all sources and links will be at the end of this comic!  But what if I said there's a way to learn that's evidence-based _and_ fun?  What if I said there's a memory card game you can play, for 20 minutes a day, to store _anything you choose_ into long-term memory, _forever?\*_  \* until you die  And it's _awesome_. I started using Spaced Repetition earlier this year to learn French.  In two _months_, I learnt more words than I did in two _years_ of high school French classes.  Since then, I've used Spaced Repetition to remember all sorts of things...  ukulele chords  computer code  friends' birthdays  anything interesting i find in books, talks, articles, etc!  ...and this lil' memory card game became a core part of my _life_.  In short, Spaced Repetition = testing + time.  You test yourself on a fact repeatedly, spacing out your repetitions over time. (But won't this take forever? Ah, as we'll see later, there's a trick...)  Spaced Repetition is free, evidence-based, and so simple you can do it with a _shoebox_.  nicky shut up  So, what's the catch? Why isn't _everyone_ already doing Spaced Repetition?  Well, the catch is that making _any_ new habit is hard – especially a weird habit like Spaced Repetition.  teacher's coming  That's why I made this badly-drawn interactive comic.  In this comic on Spaced Repetition, I'll show you WHY it works, HOW it works...  ...and help you get started with it _TODAY._  Also, throughout this comic, you can test yourself on what you've learnt, at spaced-out intervals.**That is: you'll use Spaced Repetition to learn about Spaced Repetition.** 

 Like so:

 Still, isn't "rote memorization" bad? Can't we look everything up these days? Shouldn't we learn creativity & critical thinking instead?  There _is_ no "instead". Cognitive science shows you _need_ memorization for creativity & critical thinking. (Imagine writing an essay if you know no words!)  MEMORY  art  science  Spaced Repetition isn't a "study trick". It isn't a "life hack".  It's a way to take back control of your _mind._ To make long-term memory a _choice_. To develop a lifelong love of learning...  ...to mother your own, inner Muse.  Tony Stark nearly gasped as a gloved hand trailed down his spine. The steady pressure was smooth and almost reassuring. Obama chuckled. “You mean, the–  Let's begin. 

 THE SCIENCE of SPACED REPETITION

[Intro](#0) ·[The Science](#1) ·[The Art](#2) ·[Get Started!](#3) ·[Credits](#bye) 

 In 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus performed an act of scientific masochism.  The German psychologist memorized _thousands_ of nonsense words, recorded how much he forgot over time, and discovered... **THE FORGETTING CURVE**  He found that you forget most of what you learn in the first 24 hours, then – if you don’t practice recall – your remaining memories decay exponentially.\*  \* technically the curve isn't _exactly_   
 exponential, but, eh, close enough.  Philosophers have debated about memory for millennia, but Ebbinghaus was the first to do actual _experiments._ (which have been replicated)  plz...  kill...  me...  For that reason, Hermann Ebbinghaus is known as the pioneer of the science of memory.  Here’s a playable simulation of the Forgetting Curve.**Change the rate of memory decay. What happens to the curve?**  As you can see, the less the decay, the flatter the curve – that is, the longer the memory lasts.  How fast a person’s memory decays depends on the person and the memory...  hi! sorry, what's your name again?  haha. it's susan.  But in general, a memory’s “rate of decay” slows down each time you **actively recall** it. (versus passively re-reading it)  susan. susan. susan. susan. susan.  (although, when you stop practicing, it still decays.)  okay bye sarah!  susan.  bye sandy!  SUSAN.  Here’s the simulation again, with a single active recall session.  
 (grey line: what memory would've been _without_ the recall)  
**Change the recall timing to see how it affects the curve:**  A single recall boosts memory for a bit... but in the long run, due to exponential decay of memory, a single recall changes nothing.  Is there a better way to learn? There is! The trick to remembering...  ..._is to almost forget._  To understand this, think about training your muscles. You’ll gain nothing with a weight that’s too easy...  ...nor one that’s too hard.  The same’s true of training your brain. You need **desirable difficulty**: the sweet spot of just-hard-enough.  comfort  discomfort  too easy  just right  too hard  Therefore: to best learn something, you need to recall it...  ..._just as you’re about to forget it._  Same simulation as before, but now it shows thesweet spot – where you’ve forgotten _just a little bit._ **Put the recall in the _middle_ of the sweet spot. What happens?**  See? If you time a recall just right, you can slow down the decay by a bit! Now, what about _multiple_ recalls?  Let’s say you’relazy time-efficient, so you’re only doing 4 recall sessions.  Question:_what’s the best way to spread out your recalls?_  susan  Should you have evenly spaced gaps? Gaps of increasing length? Gaps of decreasing length? Or make it unpredictable, to keep you on your toes?  \= recall  time  even gaps:  increasing gaps:  decreasing gaps:  random gaps: **Give it your best guess**, then when you’re ready, **flip the card over ↓**  Which is very counter-intuitive! You can prove to yourself this is true, by playing with the sim below. **Get all recalls into the _middle_ of the sweet spot. What spacing do you get?**  (To prove this isn't a fluke, here’s a sim where you can change the initial memory decay & sweet spot. Note how, in all but the extreme cases, the best schedule is still “increasing gaps”!)  Why _must_ the gaps increase? Because: each time you do a recall at the sweet spot of forgetting, the memory’s decay slows down...  it's  SUSAN!  –the fu  ...meaning it’ll take _longer_ to hit the sweet spot next time!  But you know what’s sweeter? This also means if you time your recalls just right...  ...you can easily keep _any number_ of things in your long-term memory,_FOREVER._  And speaking of doing active recall in order to learn, let's do some active recall on what we just learnt:  Well that's nice, but actually _finding_ a good Spaced Repetition schedule must be hard, right? _Au contraire!_ It’s actually so simple, you can even create your own automatic scheduler...  ...using a _shoebox._ 

 THE ART of SPACED REPETITION

[Intro](#0) ·[The Science](#1) ·[The Art](#2) ·[Get Started!](#3) ·[Credits](#bye) 

 You don't _have_ to use a shoebox for Spaced Repetition, but it's funnier if you do.  and this is my private tutor  ???  they're TRAINERS  we're not friends anymore  (Later, we'll look at some Spaced Repetition _apps_, like Anki & Tinycards)  This setup is called The Leitner Box. It's like a card game you play against yourself!  First, divide your box up into seven "Levels". (You can have more or fewer if you like!)  All new flashcards start at Level 1.  (If you're new to Spaced Repetition, I recommend starting with 5 new cards a day.)  When you review a card, and get it right, it moves up _one_ Level.  (If you're at the final Level, congrats! Your card retires. Off it goes, to card heaven.)  But if you review a card, and get it wrong... it has to go_all the way back down to Level 1._  (If it's already at Level 1, good news: you can keep testing yourself on it until you get it right, and move it up to Level 2)  But _when_ do we review cards? That's the trick. In the Leitner Box, we review Level 1 cards every day, Level 2 every two days, Level 3 every _FOUR_ days, Level 4 every _EIGHT_ days, etc...  The pattern is: we _double the gap_ (# of days between reviews) for each Level!  Here's what the looping 64-day game calendar looks like:  (Note: the reason we review Level 1 at the end is so you'll see your new cards _and_ the cards you forgot from higher Levels.)  (At the end of a daily game of Spaced Repetition, leave no cards in Level 1\. Test yourself until you can get them all right, and move them up to Level 2!)  (Note #2: Spaced Repetition _apps_ like Anki use a more sophisticated algorithm...)  (...but at its core, they work on the same principles as the Leitner Box)  (Note #3: Oh, and with a few index cards & tape, you can make your own foldable, looping calendar!)  (at the end, I'll link to a video tutorial for crafting a Leitner Box)  Now, to show the game in action! Here's a _step-by-step_ simulation of the Leitner Box:**(we'll see a _month-by-month_ sim later)**  Each daily review takes 20-30 minutes. Instead of watching a TV episode, you could play a card game – and remember anything you want _for life_.  However, habits are hard. If you start big, you won't get the ball rolling...  But if you start _small_, you can gain momentum, and roll your snowball bigger and bigger.  That's why I recommend _starting_ with 5 new cards a day.  Once you're comfortable with that, you can do 10 new cards/day. Then 15\. Then 20, 25, 30.  And at 30 new cards a day, you can learn _10,000+_ new facts/words/etc a _year._  na na na na na na na na na  katamari damacy  Now, here's the month-by-month simulation. Use this to calculate in advance how much _you_ can learn with Spaced Repetition!  That's it. That's how you can make long-term memory a _choice_.  Let's let that sink in. Take a break, and recall what we just learnt:  Spaced Repetition almost seems too good to be true.  
 And it is... _IF_ you fall for some very common pitfalls.  Memory isn't a bookshelf where you collect random giant tomes to impress others.  a bunch of  crap you'll  never get  around to  reading  That's to say: Spaced Repetition will fail if your cards feel_bloated_, _disconnected_ or _meaningless_.  Instead, memory is like a jigsaw puzzle: full of small, connected pieces. (This is also how neurons work: lots of small, connected things)  It's not about _collection_, it's about _connection_.  Thus, to get the most out of Spaced Repetition, you must make your cards...  SMALL  CONNECTED  & MEANINGFUL  Let's see how.  SMALL  This card sucks:  It's too big. Too much information.  Let's cut it up into smaller, connected pieces! As a rule of thumb, _each flashcard should have one & only one idea._ Like so:  Facts connect to facts. But there's other, more playful ways for cards to be...  CONNECTED  This card is... alright. It's an English word on the front, French word on the back. It's the standard for most language-learning flashcards:  But you know what would make it stick in memory better?  If you connected it to_pictures, sounds, context, and/or personal details!_ Like so:  The front now has a drawing of a cat (picture) with a fill-in-the-blank French sentence (context: grammar) about my childhood cat, Stripes. (personal)  The back now has a symbol of the noun's gender (picture), its pronunciation (sound\*), and a warning about the female version of the noun. (context: slang)  \* Obviously, paper cards can't play sounds. But apps like Anki/Tinycards can! 

 But the _most_ important connection of all, is to connect your learning to something that is...  MEANINGFUL  Personally, here's how I've learnt best: First, I try (emphasis on _try_) to **do** something.  play the ukulele  read french comics  make a web game  Inevitably, I'll get stuck. In that moment, I'll look up what I need, and **learn** something.  how do you play F#?  what's "attraper" mean?  why is javascript such a piece of sh–  And so on.  That, I believe, is the best way to keep yourself motivated while learning:  By making sure your learning is in service of _doing something you care about._  Speaking of learning, let's practice recalling what we've learnt: (this will be the second-last time!)  The consensus in the Spaced Repetition community is, after a while, **you should make your own cards.**  This way, you can connect facts to what _you_ know, what _you_ love.  That's why, in the _final_ part of this interactive comic, you're going to make your _own_ cards!  And those cards will be about...  YOU 

 To help you get started with Spaced Repetition _today_, you need to answer four questions:  WHAT?  WHY?  HOW?  WHEN?  You'll answer these questions by making flashcards! So, here's the _front_ of our first flashcard, our first question: ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sq_r6kKjZfla76nU0HUazvOjdT7Z806bjFiQAT2aLLJs/https://ncase.me/remember/pics/fcard_frontonly.png)  For example, you could use Spaced Repetition to help you learn...  a new language  a new instrument  computer programming  details of friends' lives  anything interesting you find, anywhere!  all the pokémon  Now, you write _your_ answer on the back:  (note: you can scroll back here & change your answer later)  However, recall that for Spaced Repetition to work, you need to connect it to something you _care_ about. So our next question is: ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sq_r6kKjZfla76nU0HUazvOjdT7Z806bjFiQAT2aLLJs/https://ncase.me/remember/pics/fcard_frontonly.png)  That may be too philosophical, so here's some concrete examples of a _why_ behind a _what:_ **WHAT:** a new language  
**WHY:** to speak to friends, family, lovers in their native tongue **WHAT:** computer programming  
**WHY:** to make money so you can eat **WHAT:** anything interesting  
**WHY:** curiosity, for its own sake!  So... what's _your_ why?  You now have your what and why... but we still need to pick a _how!_ That is, what tool/app do you want to use? Our next card asks: ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sq_r6kKjZfla76nU0HUazvOjdT7Z806bjFiQAT2aLLJs/https://ncase.me/remember/pics/fcard_frontonly.png)  I currently use[The Leitner Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner%5Fsystem), but my friends use[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), and for a while I used[TinyCards](https://tinycards.duolingo.com/). (links open in new tabs) Here's how they compare: **Leitner Box**   
 Pros: arts-and-craftsy, easy to use  
 Cons: not as portable as an app **Anki (app)**   
 Pros: huge community, open-source, lots of powerful features  
 Cons: kinda ugly **TinyCards (app)**   
 Pros: beautiful design, easy to use  
 Cons: max 150 cards per deck, doesn't let _you_ decide if you got a card right  (Want something else? Here's a few other tools:[SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.com/),[NimbleNotes](https://www.nimblenotes.com/),[Mnemosyne](https://mnemosyne-proj.org/))  \* _anti_\-disclaimer: i am _not_ affiliated with any of these. i just think they're cool & helpful!  So, what's it gonna be?  Just one card left! Now: doing Spaced Repetition is actually quite easy... however, doing it _as a daily habit_ is hard.  Why? Because getting the ball rolling on _any_ new habit is hard.  Hard, but straightforward. The science of habits shows that if you do the same thing, given the same cue, over and over...  have a nice day!  thanks, you too!  happy holidays!  thanks, you too!  here's your change!  thanks, you too!  ...it'll become a habit, for better or worse. So for a Spaced Repetition habit, our question is: ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sq_r6kKjZfla76nU0HUazvOjdT7Z806bjFiQAT2aLLJs/https://ncase.me/remember/pics/fcard_frontonly.png)  For example, you could play the Spaced Repetition game...  after you wake up  on your commute  before sleeping  It doesn't really matter _when_ you do it, as long as you do it daily and consistently (more or less - you can skip a day once in a while).  (Tip: whenever I try to create a new habit, I draw a circle on a calendar for each day I successfully do it)  (It's a game I play with myself! The goal is to try not break my streak, and build the longest chain I can.)  Now, let's fill out that final flashcard:  Et voilà, here's all four of your flashcards, all about you!  But like I said, I want to help you take control of your memory _today_.  Not "eventually", not "tomorrow", _TODAY_.  so to help...  let's download some **COOL GOODIES** ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sjrVefSmbBtkuV4zCban3rdoPEfp4orSVofSLGtuVcs8/https://ncase.me/remember/pics/gift.png) **FIRST:**  a wallpaper for your desktop, to remind you to play the Spaced Repetition game daily! ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sjrVefSmbBtkuV4zCban3rdoPEfp4orSVofSLGtuVcs8/https://ncase.me/remember/pics/gift.png) **SECOND:** ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sjrVefSmbBtkuV4zCban3rdoPEfp4orSVofSLGtuVcs8/https://ncase.me/remember/pics/gift.png) And finally,**THIRD:** a .zip of all the flashcards you've been practicing in this interactive comic!  (These can be your first few days' worth of Spaced Repetition cards, to help you get started! And as a plus, you'll get to remember everything you learnt here today, forever-ish.)  Which reminds me...  one last goodbye, for old time's sake, the final swan song!  ...let's review our flashcards, _all_ of them:  Sniff... It's always so hard to say goodbye...  HONK  I'll miss the time we had together...  ...but I hope we live on in each others' memories!  If you're a student, I hope Spaced Repetition helps you be more confident, and take learning into your own hands.  If you're a teacher, please oh _please_ tell your students about Spaced Repetition (& other evidence-based study habits) early on.  But whether you're in or out of school, I hope Spaced Repetition helps you develop your memory, your mind, your Muse...  "no!" screamed the mitochondria, as she slid down the cell's warm, wet throat. "i don't–  ...and learn one of life's greatest loves:  a lifelong love of learning.  (Want to learn/play more? Further reading & credits below!)

 Further Reading

 Something something shoulders of giants. Here are the reads that made Spaced Repetition a part of my daily life:

* 🤓[ Augmenting Long-Term Memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) by Michael Nielsen showed me that Spaced Repetition wasn't just a tool for memorization, it's a tool to build deep understanding. It could even be a way of _life_.
* 💬[ Fluent Forever](https://fluent-forever.com/the-book/) by Gabriel Wyner convinced me to finally (re)start learning French, and create a Leitner Box. (my 64-day calendar was adapted from this book)
* 🃏[ 20 Rules for Cards](https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules) by Piotr Wozniak taught me how to squeeze the most out of Spaced Repetition. (Note: the author also invented the algorithm used by Anki!)

 And my favorite reads on the science of learning:

* 👩‍🎓[ Why Don't Students Like School?](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Dont-Students-Like-School/dp/047059196X/) by Daniel Willingham proved to me that "mere memorization" is actually _necessary_ for creativity & critical thinking.
* ✏️[ What Works, What Doesn't \[PDF\]](http://web.archive.org/web/20190711014620/http://tlcp.depaultla.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/05/Dunlosky-et-al-2013-What-Works-What-Doesnt.pdf) by Dunlosky et al summarizes _200+ studies_ on various learning methods. In sum: common techniques like re-reading & highlighting don't work, less-common techniques like spacing & self-testing do.[ (Link to original paper)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1529100612453266)

 What's this?

 This organelle is called "mitochondria". Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. They're found in almost all eukaryotic (nucleus-having) organisms. The most widely-accepted hypothesis for the origin of mitochondria is Endosymbiotic Theory: around \~1.5 billion years ago, a prokaryotic (nucleus-lacking) cell that was "eaten" by another cell, somehow survived, and has continued to live inside them ever since.
