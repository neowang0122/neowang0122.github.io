### EDUCATION

## [ Bungled FAFSA rollout stressed out a lot of HS seniors ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/inl?mbcid=34689361.3887237&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)

There are a lot of things that lead to a high schooler crying at a kitchen table: algebra problems, decoding _Richard III_, and getting stuck in the _Bye Bye Birdie_ ensemble. But this year, the Education Department’s [botched rollout](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/inm?mblid=ce3ae845ff40&mbcid=34689361.3887237&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of its new financial aid application had seniors, their parents, college administrators, and lawmakers all feeling like they couldn’t solve for “X.”

Four years ago, US lawmakers voted to update the cumbersome 108-question financial aid application to fewer than 50 questions. The FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, helps the government and colleges determine what kind of financial aid package incoming students can receive to pay for school.

But even with a two-month delay from the old form’s usual October opening, the updated one was almost unusable when it soft-launched in December. Users reported getting stuck on questions or logged out of the site.

* Only 5.7 million FAFSAs have been submitted, according to an Education Department spokesperson, far from the 17 million expected annually. Students have until June 30 to submit.

## There’s a lot of finger-pointing

The fumbled debut of a $336+ million overhaul has Republicans blaming the Biden administration for letting the FAFSA revamp fall through the cracks while the president was laser-focused on loan forgiveness. The admin and some higher ed advocates said it’s Republicans’ fault for not approving a bigger budget for the project. But it was most likely a combination of both—plus the Department of Education’s [lack of communication](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/inn?mblid=ad42e7cfd6af&mbcid=34689361.3887237&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) around issues, experts said.

**The state of financial aid:** The Biden administration said this week that after months of quiescence, the department had finally sent its first group of student financial records to schools over the weekend. A number of colleges and universities, already nervous about sharp enrollment declines since the pandemic, proactively extended the May 1 deadline for students to commit to their schools._—MM_

Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in the US, also implied that Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition is threatening to turn Israel into a global “pariah.” The speech came as frustration mounts in the Biden administration over the civilian toll in Gaza.

Wright has long claimed that he adopted the pseudonym and authored a white paper on bitcoin in 2008, laying the groundwork for the cryptocurrency. Since then, he’s sued several developers for allegedly violating his intellectual property rights.

The company looking to colonize Mars rang in its 22nd birthday yesterday with the third test launch of its large and in-charge Starship rocket, and unlike your 22nd birthday, this one didn’t end in a spontaneous blowup.

Starship, the rocket that future NASA missions and Musk’s satellite biz are counting on, [blasted off](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ins?mblid=d74a7237e118&mbcid=34689361.3887237&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) from the Texas Gulf Coast yesterday morning and completed most of its \~hourlong test mission—detaching from the Super Heavy booster and [cruising](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/int?mblid=a79ab7acaf5e&mbcid=34689361.3887237&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) about halfway around the world—before losing contact on reentry and likely breaking up over the Indian Ocean.

**This is major progress**. The rocket’s first two orbital launches [last April](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/5wL?mblid=55cc01df54c1&mbcid=34689361.3887237&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) and [November](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/inu?mblid=1c55ef284bd8&mbcid=34689361.3887237&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) ended in explosions just minutes after takeoff. SpaceX engineers had to make 80 FAA-commissioned fixes after those launches.

**But there’s still a ways to go.** Starship is designed to be reusable, and while yesterday’s failed reentry shows it’s not yet there, it’ll have to be by the end of 2026 when Starship is contracted to help NASA shuttle astronauts to the moon (though some aerospace experts think the mission will be pushed back). Musk said Starship should successfully complete hundreds of uncrewed missions before then.

Vancouver, the city known for having idyllic beaches, being the filming location of _Riverdale,_ and giving us Ryan Reynolds, is embroiled in controversy over a new housing development.

The planned community, [Sen̓áḵw](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/inz?mblid=a25accd9489a&mbcid=34689361.3887237&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), will consist of 11 towers and 6,000 apartments. It’s being built on 10 acres of prime real estate owned by the Squamish Nation, one of Canada’s Indigenous groups, and will be the densest neighborhood in Canada when finished.

Sen̓áḵw has drawn the ire of residents of Kitsilano Point—a trendy, beachfront neighborhood filled with athleisure-donning software engineers that borders the development.

* Neighbors are concerned that proposed futuristic skyscrapers will [block their mountain view](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/inA?mblid=ed11da09854d&mbcid=34689361.3887237&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) and erode the neighborhood’s character.
* They’re also worried about potential issues caused by the density, which is only allowed because it’s being built on First Nations land and thus doesn’t fall under Vancouver’s strict zoning laws.

**But…**some members of the Indigenous community see a [subtext ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/inB?mblid=5e7a9c98961b&mbcid=34689361.3887237&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)in Vancouverites’ opposition: “Canadians aren’t used to seeing Indigenous people occupy places that are socially, economically or geographically valuable, like Sen̓áḵw,” said one Canadian journalist.

Fraud groups, often with the help of conspiring retail employees, are [tricking companies](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/in1?mblid=c0cff63d9aca&mbcid=34689361.3887237&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) into issuing refunds without the products being returned, CNBC reported. Per the National Retail Federation, return fraud accounted for $101 billion in losses for retailers last year. And for every $100 in returned merch, shops lose almost $14 to return fraud. These groups operate like sophisticated businesses, marketing their services on platforms like TikTok and Reddit. Amazon said it’s now using machine learning tools to detect the fraud.

**✢ A Note From Masterworks**

“Net annualized return” refers to the annualized internal rate of return (IRR), net of all fees and costs, to holders of Class A shares from the primary offering, calculated from the final closing date of such offering to the date the sale is consummated. A more detailed breakdown of the net annualized return calculation for each issuer can be found in the respective Form 1-U for each exit. The three (3) median returns above represent the ones closest in percentage to the median of the 12 exits with holding periods over one (1) year. Past performance is not indicative of future returns. Investing involves risk. See important disclosures at [www.masterworks.com/cd](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hO4?mblid=a263a53b3b8f&mbcid=34689361.3887237&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).
