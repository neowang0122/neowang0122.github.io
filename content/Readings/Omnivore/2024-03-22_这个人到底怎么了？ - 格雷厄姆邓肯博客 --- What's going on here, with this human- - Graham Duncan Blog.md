_The philosopher Kwame Appiah writes that “in life, the challenge is not so much to figure out how best to play the game; ==the challenge is to figure out what game you’re playing.”==_ 
_哲学家夸梅·阿皮亚 (Kwame Appiah) 写道：“在生活中，挑战不在于弄清楚如何最好地玩游戏；而在于如何玩好游戏。”挑战在于弄清楚你在玩什么游戏。”_

_When I try to figure out what game I’m playing, I see that for the last 25 years I have been playing a game of strategy applied to people, a game where over and over I try to answer the question “what’s going on here, with this human?” In this essay, I make recommendations about candidate selection based on thousands of assessments I have made and my somewhat obsessive interest in the topic._ 
_当我试图弄清楚我在玩什么游戏时，我发现在过去的 25 年里，我一直在玩一种应用于人的策略游戏，在这个游戏中，我一遍又一遍地试图回答“这里发生了什么”这个问题。 ，和这个人类？”在这篇文章中，我根据我所做的数千次评估以及我对该主题的浓厚兴趣，提出了有关候选人选择的建议。_

_My goal in this essay is to help others make better decisions on a potential hire, business partner, or even life partner as quickly and as accurately as possible. It’s made up of suggested action steps and some of the ruminations that underlie them. At the end I include my own assessment of different personality assessments and some of my go-to interview and reference questions._ 
_我在本文中的目标是帮助其他人尽可能快速、准确地对潜在员工、业务合作伙伴甚至生活伴侣做出更好的决策。它由建议的行动步骤和这些步骤背后的一些思考组成。最后，我列出了我自己对不同性格评估的评估以及我的一些面试和参考问题。_

Jerry Seinfeld once said, when asked how he felt about aging, “I think if you’re a little lucky in life you should enjoy getting older…when you’re young you can’t see what’s going on so well. You get older, you walk into a room and you see who people are faster.”  
杰里·宋飞 (Jerry Seinfeld) 曾经在被问及他对衰老有何感想时说道：“我认为，如果你生活中幸运一点，你应该享受变老的乐趣……当你年轻的时候，你看不到正在发生的事情。随着年龄的增长，你走进一个房间，你就会发现谁跑得更快。”

Toward the end of his life, Steve Jobs told Walter Isaacson, “If I had a spiritual partner at Apple, it’s Jony Ive. Jony and I think up most of the products together and then pull others in…he gets the big picture as well as the most infinitesimal details about each product.” Let’s say that the way Jobs and Ive knew each other—quirks, strengths, weaknesses—after 14 years of daily conversation was a 10.  
在生命的最后时刻，史蒂夫·乔布斯告诉沃尔特·艾萨克森：“如果我在苹果有一个精神伴侣，那就是乔尼·艾维。乔尼和我一起想出了大部分产品，然后让其他人参与进来……他了解每个产品的整体情况以及最微小的细节。”假设乔布斯和艾维对彼此的了解程度——怪癖、优点、缺点——经过 14 年的日常交谈后，得分为 10。

How close to that 10 can you get when you’re first getting to know someone and deciding whether they are a fit for your team?  
当您第一次了解某人并决定他们是否适合您的团队时，您能接近这 10 个吗？

When I started making those sorts of judgments about people, I’d guess my average was a 3\. I’ve since done thousands of interviews, spent just as many hours talking to references, and helped hire hundreds of people—as consultants for a research firm that I helped run right after college, and since then as analysts and investors in my role investing large pools of capital. Now, when I’m in the zone and the conditions are right, I think I can sometimes get to a 7.  
当我开始对人做出这样的判断时，我猜我的平均分是 3。此后我进行了数千次面试，花了同样多的时间与推荐人交谈，并帮助雇用了数百人——作为一家公司的顾问。大学毕业后，我帮助运营了一家研究公司，从那时起，我就以分析师和投资者的身份投资了大量资金。现在，当我处于状态并且条件合适时，我想我有时可以达到7分。

A lot of people, in my industry and others, see all of this as a drag, a distraction from the central mission of their team. But I’ve come to consider it the most important skill for anyone building teams—and to believe that, to the extent I have any unique skill, this is it. In the work context, managing the complexity around people is the most important skill for anyone building a business. As the gaming company Valve puts it: “Hiring well is the most important thing in the universe.”  
在我的行业和其他行业中，很多人都认为这一切都是一种拖累，分散了他们团队核心使命的注意力。但我开始认为，对于任何组建团队的人来说，这是最重要的技能，并且相信，就我拥有的任何独特技能而言，就是这样。在工作环境中，管理人员周围的复杂性是任何创业者最重要的技能。正如游戏公司 Valve 所说：“招聘好员工是世界上最重要的事情。”

This view of hiring as a key business skill is new. It was not true of industrial companies (U.S. Steel, Dow Chemicals), but complex intellectual endeavors like SpaceX are on a new playing field. Or consider the U.S. Army of WWII versus the Navy SEALs of today: the battlefield is even more complex, so selecting for the most talented players gives an organization even more leverage than in the past.  
这种将招聘视为关键商业技能的观点是新的。工业公司（美国钢铁公司、陶氏化学公司）的情况并非如此，但像 SpaceX 这样复杂的智力事业正处于一个新的竞争环境中。或者考虑一下二战时期的美国陆军与今天的海豹突击队：战场更加复杂，因此选择最有才华的球员可以让组织比过去拥有更大的影响力。

After reading a large number of business school case studies, a friend of UCLA business strategy professor Richard Rumelt observed to him that “‘it looks to me as if there is really only one question you’re asking in each case: What’s going on here?’” Rumelt writes: “it was something I’ve never heard said explicitly but it was instantly and obviously correct. A great deal of strategy work is trying to figure out what is going on. Not just deciding what to do, but the more fundamental problem of comprehending the situation.”  
在阅读了大量商学院案例研究后，加州大学洛杉矶分校商业战略教授理查德·鲁梅尔特的一位朋友对他说：“在我看来，在每种情况下，你实际上只问一个问题：这里发生了什么？” ？’”鲁梅尔特写道：“这是我从未听过明确说过的话，但它立即且明显是正确的。大量的战略工作正在试图弄清楚正在发生什么。不仅仅是决定要做什么，而是更根本的问题，即理解形势。”

It can be useful, when interviewing someone, to take Rumelt’s cue and ask explicitly: what’s going on here with this person in front of me? The more I’ve done it, the more I realize that what most people think of as the hard parts of hiring—asking just the right question that catches the candidate off guard, defining the role correctly, assessing the person’s skills—are less important than a more basic task: how do you see someone, including yourself, clearly?  
在采访某人时，遵循鲁梅尔特的暗示并明确地询问：我面前的这个人发生了什么事？我做得越多，我就越意识到，大多数人认为招聘中最困难的部分——提出让候选人措手不及的正确问题、正确定义角色、评估应聘者的技能——并不那么重要。而不是一个更基本的任务：你如何清楚地看到某人，包括你自己？

Seeing people clearly—or at least more clearly—matters not just when finding the “best” hire, but in identifying the best role for them. Even looking at those of us who are lucky enough to have a high degree of choice about what we do with our work, I’ll bet that as few as 20% of us are in the seat that best optimizes our talents and skills at any given time—the seat that makes us feel at home in the world. That’s not good for the 80%, and it’s not good for their teams either.  
清楚地看到人——或者至少更清楚地看到人——不仅在寻找“最佳”员工时很重要，而且在确定最适合他们的角色时也很重要。即使看看我们这些足够幸运，对自己的工作有高度选择的人，我敢打赌，我们中只有 20% 的人处于最能优化我们的才能和技能的位置。给定的时间——让我们在世界上有宾至如归的感觉的座位。这对 80% 的人来说不好，对他们的团队也不好。

The poet David Whyte describes the unfolding of life and career as a “conversation with reality”:  
诗人大卫·怀特将生活和事业的展开描述为“与现实的对话”：

> _Whatever a human being desires for themselves will not come about exactly as they first imagined it or first laid it out in their minds…what always happens is the meeting between what you desire from your world and what the world desires of you. It’s this frontier where you overhear yourself and you overhear the world._ 
> _无论一个人对自己的渴望是什么，都不会完全按照他们最初想象或首先在他们的头脑中提出的那样实现……总是发生的是你对世界的渴望和世界对你的渴望之间的相遇。正是在这个前沿，你可以无意中听到自己的声音，也可以无意中听到世界的声音。_
> 
> _And that frontier is the only place where things are real…in which you just try to keep an integrity and groundedness while keeping your eyes and your voice dedicated toward the horizon that you’re going to, or the horizon in another person you’re meeting._ 
> _而这个边界是唯一一个事物真实的地方……在这个边界中，你只是努力保持正直和脚踏实地，同时将你的眼睛和声音专注于你要去的地平线，或者你所在的另一个人的地平线。会议。_

Whyte captures how hiring can be an art form. When you see people clearly, you see the transcript of their conversation with reality up until that moment of your meeting, and you glimpse the horizon that stretches out ahead of them. And then sometimes you can help them overhear themselves and overhear what the world wants from them, whether or not that includes working in the role that you had initially imagined for them.  
怀特阐述了招聘如何成为一门艺术。当你清楚地看到人们时，你会看到他们与现实的对话记录，直到你们见面的那一刻，你会瞥见他们前方延伸的地平线。有时你可以帮助他们无意中听到自己的声音，并无意中听到世界对他们的期望，无论这是否包括扮演你最初为他们想象的角色。

There are three parts to expanding your ability to see people more clearly: seeing your own reflection in the window, seeing the elephants in the room, and seeing the water.  
可以通过三个部分来扩展您更清楚地看到别人的能力：看到窗户中自己的倒影、看到房间里的大象以及看到水。

**Part I: Seeing your Reflection in the Window** 
**第一部分：在窗户中看到自己的倒影**

In his book _Waking Up_, Sam Harris offers a great metaphor for seeing through frames:  
萨姆·哈里斯（Sam Harris）在他的《醒来》一书中提供了一个关于透过框架观看的精彩比喻：

> _Imagine that you want to show another person how a window can also function like a mirror. As it happens, your friend has never seen this effect and is quite skeptical of your claims. You direct her attention to the largest window in your house, and although the conditions are perfect for seeing her reflection, she immediately becomes captivated by the world outside. What a beautiful view! Who are your neighbors? Is that a redwood or a Douglas fir? You begin to speak about there being two views and about the fact that your friend’s reflection stands before her even now, but she notices only that the neighbor’s dog has slipped out the front door and is now dashing down the sidewalk. In every moment, it is clear to you that your friend is staring directly through the image of her face without seeing it._ 
> _想象一下，您想向另一个人展示窗户如何也能像镜子一样发挥作用。碰巧的是，你的朋友从未见过这种效果，并且对你的说法非常怀疑。你将她的注意力引向家里最大的窗户，尽管条件非常适合看到她的倒影，但她立即就被外面的世界迷住了。多么美丽的景色啊！谁是你的邻居？那是红杉还是花旗松？你开始谈论有两种观点，以及你朋友的倒影现在就站在她面前的事实，但她只注意到邻居的狗已经溜出前门，现在正在人行道上奔跑。每时每刻，您都清楚地看到您的朋友正直视着她的脸部图像，而没有看到它。_

How do you convey that there’s an aspect of the window that is also a mirror? As Harris says, it’s actually really hard.  
你如何表达窗户的一个侧面也是一面镜子？正如哈里斯所说，这实际上非常困难。

But you really can’t see another person clearly unless you can first see yourself clearly: both of you are together creating the interaction you are in. If you’re holding your breath while you speak, you may cause the other person to hold their breath and then you might experience them as nervous. If your question implies a value you place in competitiveness, that part of them may come forward in the answer in a way that would not in other settings.  
但是，除非您首先能够清楚地看到自己，否则您确实无法清楚地看到另一个人：你们俩一起创造了你们所处的互动。如果您说话时屏住呼吸，您可能会导致对方屏住呼吸呼吸，然后你可能会感到他们紧张。如果你的问题暗示了你对竞争力的重视，那么这部分人可能会以其他情况下不会的方式出现在答案中。

If I picture my thirty-year-old self doing an interview, I see him as the friend looking through the window: not seeing the way his mind was constantly making snap judgments about the candidate, creating stories with the slightest bit of material, “I like this,” “I don’t like that.” He would project his reality onto the reality of the other person, missing that, for instance, often even very senior people are not their usual selves in a formal interview setting, that there’s a power dynamic that he should not take lightly. He would not yet be aware that while his sensitivity to being hustled is a gift, it also creates a blind spot that causes him to mistakenly pass on a particularly good sales person or someone who is earlier in their career and still relies on jargon or cliché.  
如果我想象三十岁的自己在接受采访，我会把他视为透过窗户看的朋友：看不到他的头脑不断对候选人做出仓促的判断，用最轻微的材料编造故事，“我喜欢这个，”“我不喜欢那个。”他会把自己的现实投射到对方的现实上，而忽略了这一点，例如，即使是非常资深的人，在正式面试的环境中也常常表现出不正常的自我，而他不应该掉以轻心的权力动态。他还没有意识到，虽然他对被催促的敏感度是一种天赋，但这也造成了一个盲点，导致他错误地忽略了一位特别优秀的销售人员或职业生涯早期但仍然依赖行话或陈词滥调的人。

One way that I’ve tried to help myself see the reflections in the window is by using personality assessments. I’ve taken well over thirty different personality assessments over the years to try to glimpse my own strengths and weaknesses and to try to see other people more clearly.  
我试图帮助自己看到窗口中的倒影的一种方法是使用性格评估。多年来，我进行了三十多次不同的性格评估，试图了解自己的优点和缺点，并尝试更清楚地了解其他人。

Like many people, my first experience was with Myers–Briggs—I tend to test as an INTP—but I I’ve used everything from the “Big Five” or OCEAN (Open-minded, Conscientious, Extroverted, Agreeable, Neurotic), to ghSMART questions (“when I call your former manager, how will they rate your performance on a scale of 1-100?”), to former Bain consultant Patrick Lencioni’s idea of “humble, hungry and smart” as the attributes of an ideal team player. There are also more philosophical systems, such as Bob Kegan’s framework of adult development, and the Enneagram, that require more up-front time investment. (At the bottom of this piece I discuss my experience with different assessment tools.) I recommend using more than one, to avoid becoming stuck seeing through just one framework.  
和许多人一样，我的第一次经历是迈尔斯-布里格斯——我倾向于以 INTP 的身份进行测试——但我已经使用了“五大”或海洋（思想开放、认真、外向、宜人、神经质）中的所有内容， ghSMART 问题（“当我给你的前任经理打电话时，他们会如何从 1-100 分的范围内评价你的表现？”），前贝恩顾问帕特里克·伦西奥尼 (Patrick Lencioni) 将“谦虚、饥饿和聪明”视为理想的特质有团队精神的人。还有更多的哲学体系，例如鲍勃·基根的成人发展框架和九型人格，需要更多的前期投入。 （在本文的底部，我讨论了我使用不同评估工具的经验。）我建议使用多个工具，以避免只通过一个框架进行查看。

**Part II: Seeing the Elephants in the Room** 
**第二部分：看到房间里的大象**

Seeing others clearly is about tuning into a process, a way of seeing. The psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s metaphor is good. Visualize yourself riding a huge elephant while you interview someone riding a second huge elephant (Haidt apparently came to this metaphor of rider and elephant during a psychedelic trip.) Haidt advises imagining your conscious mind as the rider and your unconscious drives as the elephant—powerful and willful and ultimately inclined to take the rider where the elephant wants to go most of the time. The key insight is that the rider is not always a reliable witness about the elephant they ride.  
清楚地看到别人就是调整到一个过程，一种看待的方式。心理学家乔纳森·海特的比喻很好。想象自己骑着一头巨大的大象，同时采访另一个骑着第二头巨大大象的人（海特显然是在一次迷幻之旅中想到了骑手和大象的比喻。）海特建议将你的意识想象为骑手，将你的无意识想象为大象——强大任性并最终倾向于将骑象者带到大象最想去的地方。关键的见解是，骑手并不总是他们所骑大象的可靠见证人。

So let’s reframe the interview process: there are two elephants in the room, yours and that of the person you’re trying to see. The bad news is that you’re mostly blind to both elephants. The good news is that there are a lot of other riders who’ve traveled alongside the other rider and elephant. If you take your perspective on the rider and your glimpses of his or her elephant, and add everyone else’s experience of the rider and their elephant, and then control a bit for your own elephant and the references’ own elephants, you can get a good sense of how the candidate’s rider-elephant combination behaves.  
因此，让我们重新构建面试过程：房间里有两只大象，你的和你想见的人的大象。坏消息是你对这两头大象都视而不见。好消息是，还有很多其他骑手与其他骑手和大象一起旅行。如果你从自己的角度看待骑手和他或她的大象，并添加其他人对骑手和他们的大象的经验，然后对你自己的大象和参考人自己的大象进行一些控制，你可以得到一个很好的结果。对候选人的骑象者和大象组合的行为方式的感觉。

There is a difference between what Chris Argyris called “espoused theory” (what someone says when they are interviewed) versus their “theory in use” (the mental models that actually drive their actions in daily life). Note that Argyris was not making the obvious distinction between someone’s theory and action, but instead the distinction between espoused theory and actual theory in use. Interviewing the rider is useful, but you have to keep in mind that in the warp and woof of day-to-day reality, the various “espoused theories” from the rider more often give way to the “theories in use” of the elephant.  
克里斯·阿吉里斯（Chris Argyris）所说的“拥护的理论”（某人在接受采访时所说的）与他们的“使用的理论”（在日常生活中实际驱动他们行为的心理模型）之间存在差异。请注意，阿吉里斯并没有对某人的理论和行动做出明显的区分，而是对所拥护的理论和实际使用的理论进行了区分。采访骑手是有用的，但你必须记住，在日常生活的现实中，骑手的各种“拥护的理论”往往让位于大象的“使用的理论” 。

Questions like “what are you compulsive about?” can sometimes reveal the other person’s elephant. Or: “Where have you experienced a moment of ignition, when you saw some older person doing an activity and you intuited that they were wired the same way you were, and you said to yourself ‘I want to be that’?” Or: “How would your spouse/sibling/parent describe you with ten adjectives?” If the candidate is capable of taking someone else’s perspective and willing to convey it (which happens roughly 50% of the time, more often in older candidates), then the adjectives tend to help you see both rider and elephant.  
诸如“你对什么有强迫症？”之类的问题。有时会暴露对方的大象。或者：“当你看到一些老年人在做某项活动，你直觉地认为他们和你一样，你对自己说‘我想成为那样’时，你在哪里经历过激情燃烧的时刻？”或者：“你的配偶/兄弟姐妹/父母会如何用十个形容词来形容你？”如果候选人能够站在别人的角度并愿意表达出来（这种情况发生在大约 50% 的情况下，在年长的候选人中更常见），那么这些形容词往往会帮助你同时看到骑手和大象。

During interviews, I try to create a stillness that helps separate signal from noise, elephants from riders. The easiest way to create conditions of stillness is to talk very little. It also helps to have the candidate you’re trying to see clearly ask you questions. Questions have very high signal value compared to most anything else you can get from a candidate. This is harder to do in practice than you might think—you need to make the candidate feel safe enough to ask their true questions, and you need to answer concisely or you’ll run out of time (which is particularly hard if the person asks good questions). I write down each question and sometimes respond with “I’ll answer, but first I’m curious, why did you ask that?” I’m looking for the felt sense of a “hungry mind” based on the way their questions flow. That’s very hard to fake.  
在采访中，我尝试营造一种安静的氛围，以帮助区分信号与噪音、大象与骑手。创造安静环境的最简单方法就是少说话。让你想见的候选人清楚地向你提问也很有帮助。与你从候选人那里得到的大多数其他信息相比，问题具有非常高的信号价值。这在实践中比你想象的更难做到——你需要让候选人感到足够安全，可以提出他们真正的问题，并且你需要简洁地回答，否则你会耗尽时间（如果候选人问这个问题，这尤其困难）好问题）。我写下每个问题，有时会回答“我会回答，但首先我很好奇，你为什么问这个？”我正在根据他们提出问题的方式来寻找“饥饿的头脑”的感觉。这很难伪造。

Try to unburden the interview of too many assumptions you have about the role. I like asking up-front, “So what criteria would you use if you were the one hiring someone for this role?” I love this question because of how unexpected the answers are. Some are tactical when you expect abstraction. Some improve your own criteria. Some use jargon that may indicate they are playing someone else’s game versus authoring their own. All are quite revealing.  
尝试在面试中消除你对这个职位的太多假设。我喜欢提前问：“那么，如果你是招聘这个职位的人，你会使用什么标准？”我喜欢这个问题，因为答案出乎意料。当你期望抽象时，有些是战术性的。有些提高了您自己的标准。有些人使用的术语可能表明他们正在玩别人的游戏而不是创作自己的游戏。一切都很有启发性。

While you may be able to catch glimpses of the elephant in your meeting, it’s important to remember that you’re basically blind. Most of the time, it will be more effective and efficient to speak to other people who know how that elephant and rider go together—their shared “theory in use”—and who have experienced the combination in action, ideally over a large number of iterations over a long time (the way their spouse or sibling knows them).  
虽然您可能能够在会议中瞥见大象，但重要的是要记住，您基本上是盲目的。大多数时候，与其他人交谈会更有效和高效，因为他们知道大象和骑手是如何结合在一起的——他们共享“使用理论”——并且在行动中经历过这种结合，最好是在大量的实践中经历过这种结合。很长一段时间的迭代（他们的配偶或兄弟姐妹认识他们的方式）。

An in-person interview is only one input, and not necessarily the most valuable one. Relying on my own impression of people has at times worked out okay, but I’ve found that maintaining humility about one’s own ability to see someone clearly during a one- or two-hour interview in a contrived setting is harder than I thought at first.  
面对面的采访只是一种输入，不一定是最有价值的一种。依靠自己对他人的印象有时效果还不错，但我发现，在人为的环境中进行一到两个小时的采访时，对自己清楚地了解某人的能力保持谦虚比我一开始想象的要困难。

Before an interview, I sometimes re-read this great passage from Philip Roth’s _American Pastoral_:  
在接受采访之前，我有时会重读菲利普·罗斯（Philip Roth）的《美国田园诗》中的这段伟大的段落：

> _You might as well have the brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them, while you’re anticipating meeting them; you get them wrong while you’re with them; and then you go home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception._ 
> _你可能还拥有坦克般的大脑。在你见到他们之前，当你期待见到他们时，你就弄错了；当你和他们在一起时，你会误解他们；然后你回家告诉其他人这次会议的情况，你又把他们搞错了。因为你的情况通常也是如此，所以整个事情实际上是一个令人眼花缭乱的幻象，没有任何感知，是一场令人震惊的误解闹剧。_

I now consider in-person references with someone who knows the candidate well 5x more valuable than an interview. They can be 10x more valuable when you are already in a high-trust relationship with the reference-giver, and the reference-giver is in a position to see the candidate clearly, with no agendas and few blind spots of their own.  
现在，我认为与熟悉候选人的人进行面对面的推荐比面试更有价值 5 倍。当你已经与推荐人建立了高度信任的关系，并且推荐人能够清楚地看到候选人，没有议程，也没有自己的盲点时，它们的价值可能会高出十倍。

Given the importance of references, the highest purpose of your own interview with a candidate might be to improve your ability to conduct reference interviews, where you hold your own view as just one in a collection of views. This requires an ability to hold multiple perspectives at once, a state of partial knowing that the poet John Keats called “[negative capability](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative%5Fcapability)”—in one author’s definition, “the innocence from agendas that enables one to become like what one observes rather than impose the self upon it, the patient and lingering curiosity, the willingness to wait and delay knowing, that allows a person to reach into the different reality than his or her own.” This is difficult to do because your own impressions from the interview are so vivid and multi-sensory, and everyone else’s views are mainly conveyed through language.  
鉴于参考资料的重要性，您自己与候选人面试的最高目的可能是提高您进行参考资料面试的能力，在这种情况下，您将自己的观点视为一系列观点中的一个。这需要一种同时持有多种观点的能力，这是一种部分了解的状态，诗人约翰·济慈（John Keats）称之为“消极能力”——用一位作者的定义来说，“议程中的纯真使人能够成为自己所观察到的样子，而不是将其强加于人”。自我、耐心和挥之不去的好奇心、愿意等待和延迟了解的意愿，使一个人能够接触到与他或她自己不同的现实。”这很难做到，因为你自己在采访中的印象是如此生动和多感官，而其他人的观点主要是通过语言来传达的。

In my experience, holding your own perspective alongside those of references should feel slightly uncomfortable and disorienting, or you’re doing it wrong. You should find the candidate confusing at times. If you first see their dysfunction, you should know you have yet to find their genius, and vice versa.  
根据我的经验，将自己的观点与参考文献的观点结合起来应该会感到有点不舒服和迷失方向，或者你做错了。您有时会发现候选人感到困惑。如果你第一次看到他们的功能障碍，你应该知道你还没有发现他们的天才，反之亦然。

I try to conduct references with an eye to quirky forms of excellence. When I’m on the receiving end of reference calls, I notice that the caller is often subtly framing the exercise with a mildly suspicious “gotcha” vibe (“so why did George leave after only two years?”). I don’t find that particularly effective; it tends to make me shut down as a reference giver. Instead, when I’m calling someone, I try to imagine myself as head of people operations for the entire hedge fund or private equity ecosystem, that I’m agnostic as to where they should sit and just trying to help them get to the best spot. That mindset seems to allow me to size up people more generously and accurately, and to accommodate more quirkiness.  
我尝试着眼于奇异的卓越形式进行参考。当我接到推荐电话时，我注意到来电者经常巧妙地以一种有点可疑的“陷阱”氛围来巧妙地构建这个练习（“那么为什么乔治只在两年后就离开了？”）。我觉得这不是特别有效；这往往会让我失去推荐人的身份。相反，当我打电话给某人时，我尝试将自己想象为整个对冲基金或私募股权生态系统的人员运营主管，我不知道他们应该坐在哪里，只是试图帮助他们达到最佳状态点。这种心态似乎让我能够更慷慨、更准确地评估人们，并适应更多的怪癖。

As your sample size of references goes up, you can begin to calibrate on the credibility of the reference giver (what’s their sample size? What are their biases?) as well as to tune into what a “table-pounding” reference sounds like. Fourteen years later I still remember a reference I did for our CFO hire: the woman who had worked with him had a tone of “why are you wasting your time talking to me and not spending your time trying to convince him to join you?” She felt slightly sorry for me that I didn’t get it yet. I’ve listened for that tone ever since on other references, and in the rare moments I hear it, it’s always proven to be high signal.  
随着参考样本量的增加，您可以开始校准参考提供者的可信度（他们的样本量是多少？他们的偏见是什么？），并调整“敲桌子”参考的声音。十四年后，我仍然记得我为我们的首席财务官招聘所做的推荐：与他共事的那位女士的语气是“你为什么浪费时间和我说话而不花时间说服他加入你？”她为我还没有明白而感到有点遗憾。从那时起，我就在其他参考文献中聆听过这种音调，在我听到它的极少数时刻，它总是被证明是高信号。

The hardest part is understanding the dog that doesn’t bark. If you don’t hear that table pounding from someone who knows the reference well, is it contextual in some way (the person is tired, you caught them right after a tough conversation, they are jealous, etc.) or is there signal there? It’s one element of the process that requires the 10,000 hours of practice to get calibrated.  
最难的部分是理解不叫的狗。如果你没有听到熟悉该对象的人发出的敲击桌子的声音，那么它是否在某种程度上与上下文相关（这个人很累，你在一场艰难的谈话后立即抓住了他们，他们嫉妒等等）或者那里是否有信号？这是需要 10,000 小时练习才能校准的流程要素之一。

I also try to stick to the default assumption that “everyone is an A player at something.” It’s a more effective and more dynamic way to approach an interview—a live, fascinating puzzle to discover what the elephant and the rider do well—rather than going in with the purpose of determining whether someone is an A player in a binary, Manichean way. I prefer to imagine that I’m trying to find the candidate the best possible job for them; it may be the job I had in mind, or something else altogether.  
我还尝试坚持默认的假设，即“每个人在某方面都是一流的”。这是一种更有效、更动态的采访方式——一个生动、有趣的谜题，旨在发现大象和骑手的擅长之处——而不是用二元的、摩尼教的方式来确定某人是否是 A 级玩家。我更愿意想象我正在努力为候选人找到最适合他们的工作；这可能是我想要的工作，也可能是别的什么。

**Part III: Seeing the Water** 
**第三部分：看水**

In 2005, David Foster Wallace delivered what has become a famous commencement speech at Kenyon College. He started it with a joke about two young fish who are swimming along and encounter an older, wiser fish. “Hey boys, how’s the water?” the older fish asks. The junior fish don’t reply, but a minute later one turns to the other and asks, “What the heck is water?”  
2005 年，大卫·福斯特·华莱士在凯尼恩学院发表了著名的毕业典礼演讲。他以一个笑话开始，讲的是两条小鱼在游动时遇到了一条更老、更聪明的鱼。 “嘿，孩子们，水怎么样？”老鱼问道。小鱼没有回答，但一分钟后，一条转向另一条问：“水到底是什么？”

It’s really hard to see the water in your own local ecosystem, and only slightly easier to see the water in someone else’s. Context matters. I used to assume I could identify a core set of attributes that would work across ecosystems. But although people are wired in certain ways that make them consistent across contexts, they are in other ways extremely sensitive to context.  
在自己当地的生态系统中看到水确实很难，而在别人的生态系统中看到水则稍微容易一些。背景很重要。我曾经认为我可以确定一组适用于整个生态系统的核心属性。但是，尽管人们以某些方式连接起来，使他们在不同的环境中保持一致，但他们在其他方面对环境极其敏感。

I sometimes visualize meeting one person as the equivalent of meeting the Ocean’s 11 crew together at once, wrapped up in one human envelope—we each have distinct parts, and we tell a story to ourselves and the world that they are a coherent whole, but depending on the context different parts step forward into the light on the stage. (To read more on “parts” theory, see [Internal Family Systems](https://ifs-institute.com/resources/articles/larger-self).)  
有时，我想象与一个人会面就相当于同时与海洋中的 11 名船员会面，他们被包裹在一个人类信封中——我们每个人都有不同的部分，我们向自己和世界讲述一个故事，他们是一个连贯的整体，但是根据不同的背景，不同的部分走向舞台上的灯光。 （要了解有关“部分”理论的更多信息，请参阅内部家庭系统。）

I now believe that there is no such thing as an A player in the abstract, across all time, in whatever ecosystem they end up in. The former head of recruiting at Bridgewater, Jeff Hunter, has a great[ essay](https://www.talentism.com/post/the-myth-of-a-players) in which he points out that former head of Apple stores Ron Johnson was an “A player” by any definition in Steve World (he was on the short list to succeed Jobs), but became a “C player” after Bill Ackman and his partners made Johnson head of JCPenney (where he was summarily fired after a poor performance).  
我现在相信，抽象意义上的一流球员是不存在的，无论他们最终处于什么生态系统，无论他们最终进入什么生态系统。桥水基金前招聘主管杰夫·亨特(Jeff Hunter)有一篇很棒的文章，他在文章中指出：前苹果商店负责人罗恩·约翰逊（Ron Johnson）在史蒂夫世界（Steve World）的任何定义中都是“A级玩家”（他在接替乔布斯的候选名单上），但在比尔·阿克曼（Bill Ackman）和他的合伙人让约翰逊担任JCPenney的负责人后，他成为了“C级玩家”（他因表现不佳而被立即解雇）。

When you’re taking someone from one ecosystem to another, changing their context, you have to try to see the water in both. It’s disruptive and risky to take someone out of the setting in which they’re thriving, since there are a lot of subtle things going on in the original that may not be immediately obvious. How much of their success depends on the water in the first ecosystem? Was there someone there who believed in them that set a positive feedback loop in motion that may not persist across systems? Try to understand as much as possible about “what’s going on here” in the candidate’s prior ecosystem. For instance in the investment management context, often a portfolio manager will run a large idea by their boss and subtle reactions (a raised eyebrow, a long pause) will cause them to actually size the position smaller. That constant tension is constructive, and if you take the portfolio manager out of that container they will not perform in the same way in the absence of the tension.  
当你将某人从一个生态系统带到另一个生态系统并改变他们的环境时，你必须尝试看到两个生态系统中的水。将某人带出他们正在蓬勃发展的环境是具有破坏性和风险的，因为原著中发生了很多微妙的事情，这些事情可能不会立即显而易见。他们的成功在多大程度上取决于第一个生态系统中的水？是否有人相信它们，从而设置了一个可能不会在整个系统中持续存在的正反馈循环？尝试尽可能多地了解候选人之前的生态系统中“正在发生什么”。例如，在投资管理领域，投资组合经理通常会根据老板的想法提出一个大想法，而微妙的反应（扬起眉毛，长时间停顿）会导致他们实际上缩小头寸规模。这种持续的紧张是有建设性的，如果你把投资组合经理从这个容器中拿出来，他们在没有紧张的情况下将不会以同样的方式表现。

This particularly applies to people who leave to start their own companies—in part because they may have a hard time recreating the culture and context that allowed them to thrive when they worked in a structure designed by someone else. (I discussed this transition in my[ Letter to a friend who may start a new investment platform](https://grahamduncan.blog/letter-to-a-friend-who-may-start-a-new-investment-platform/).)  
这尤其适用于那些离开公司创办自己公司的人，部分原因是他们可能很难重建在别人设计的结构中工作时能够蓬勃发展的文化和环境。 （我在给一位可能建立新投资平台的朋友的信中讨论了这一转变。）

It’s even possible that strengths in one context become weaknesses in another. The Enneagram personality system stresses that each “type,” a term to describe one of nine ego patterns, has a gift, but tends to get into trouble when it leans too much into this gift. Take someone who is super motivated and who loves to win, but because of this competitiveness doesn’t give as much as they get from peers. In one ecosystem they develop a reputation as a talented “taker” that people are wary of, while in another they are celebrated without reservation.  
一种情况下的优势甚至有可能在另一种情况下变成劣势。九型人格系统强调，每种“类型”（描述九种自我模式之一的术语）都有一种天赋，但当它过于依赖这种天赋时，往往会陷入麻烦。就拿一个超级有动力、热爱胜利的人来说，但由于这种竞争力，他们并没有从同龄人那里得到那么多。在一个生态系统中，他们被誉为才华横溢的“接受者”，人们对此持谨慎态度，而在另一个生态系统中，他们却毫无保留地受到赞扬。

One marker that I’m seeing someone clearly is when I understand how their strengths are also their weaknesses, how their genius lives right next to their dysfunction. I know that I’m further away from clarity when I am overly excited or overly skeptical.  
我清楚地看到一个人的一个标志是，当我了解他们的优点也是他们的缺点，他们的天才如何与他们的缺陷并存时。我知道当我过度兴奋或过度怀疑时，我就会离清晰更远。

Different ecosystems have different aesthetics, and you want to tune in to someone’s prior aesthetic context if you plan to change it. A subtle but important element of context is whether the members of a team believe in each other. I’ve been in contexts where my boss believed in me, and contexts where they didn’t. I performed well in the former, badly in the latter. If you’re the player, try to hold out for the coach who appears capable of believing in you. You can often intuit that based on how the current team talks about that manager; former team members are likely even higher signal. And if you’re the manager, try to only hire people you can genuinely imagine believing in, where you can perceive their particular flame of genius and stoke it.  
不同的生态系统有不同的审美，如果你打算改变某人之前的审美背景，你需要调整它。背景的一个微妙但重要的因素是团队成员是否相互信任。我经历过老板相信我的环境，也经历过老板不信任我的环境。我在前者中表现良好，在后者中表现不佳。如果你是球员，请尝试坚持支持看起来有能力相信你的教练。根据当前团队如何谈论该经理，你通常可以凭直觉看出这一点；前团队成员的信号可能更高。如果您是经理，请尝试只雇用您真正可以想象信任的人，在那里您可以感知他们独特的天才火焰并激发它。

One of the greatest gifts we have for each other, for our children and spouses, for our teammates, is the positive feedback loop we can put someone into purely by believing in them, by seeing their genius and their dysfunction clearly and then helping them construct conditions for the former to flourish.  
我们给彼此、给我们的孩子和配偶、给我们的队友的最伟大的礼物之一，就是我们可以纯粹通过相信某人，清楚地看到他们的天才和他们的缺陷，然后帮助他们构建积极的反馈循环。前者蓬勃发展的条件。

**ASSESSING THE ASSESSMENTS** 
**评估评估**

**Myers–Briggs 迈尔斯-布里格斯**

Like many people, my first exposure to personality assessments was Myers–Briggs, a tool that friends who worked at McKinsey were obsessed with as they tried to understand why some people work well together on teams and some don’t click. Supposedly around 80% of McKinsey’s staff are one profile, ENTJ, and Myers–Briggs gives everyone a framework for understanding why other patterns are trickier to manage.   
和很多人一样，我第一次接触性格评估是迈尔斯-布里格斯（Myers-Briggs），在麦肯锡工作的朋友们都痴迷于这个工具，因为他们试图理解为什么有些人在团队中合作得很好，而有些人却不能合作。据说麦肯锡大约 80% 的员工都是 ENTJ 类型，而迈尔斯-布里格斯为每个人提供了一个框架，帮助他们理解为什么其他模式更难管理。

I tend to test as an “[INTP](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality).” Everyone now understands the usefulness of introversion versus extroversion. The difference between the “P” (extreme comfort with uncertainty) vs. colleagues and romantic partners who are “J” (a tendency to nail things down, to be decisive and minimize uncertainty) has also been useful at times. When I interview people I also sometimes notice the “S” (sensing) tendency to be super literal and concrete, in good and bad ways, versus the more abstract “N” (intuition). I think it’s particularly useful to track S vs. N between yourself and someone you work for or who works for you, because communication difficulties may boil down to that dimension, and it’s useful to have a vocabulary for the tension.  
我倾向于以“INTP”的身份进行测试。现在每个人都了解内向与外向的有用性。 “P”（对不确定性感到极度舒适）与“J”（倾向于把事情搞定、果断并尽量减少不确定性）的同事和恋人之间的区别有时也很有用。当我采访人们时，我有时也会注意到“S”（感觉）倾向于超级字面和具体，无论好坏，与更抽象的“N”（直觉）相比。我认为追踪你和你的上司或为你工作的人之间的 S 与 N 之间的关系特别有用，因为沟通困难可能归结为这个维度，并且拥有应对紧张关系的词汇很有用。

**High vs Low Self-Monitors** 
**高与低自我监控**

A second assessment tool came from a friend who worked at McKinsey. She got my attention when she said the only thing she’d learned at Harvard Business School was the[ distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-monitoring) between high self-monitors—people who adjust to their audience, and are thus high flexibility, lower integrity—and low self-monitors—people who in good and bad ways don’t adjust to their audience and are thus high integrity, lower flexibility.   
第二个评估工具来自一位在麦肯锡工作的朋友。当她说她在哈佛商学院学到的唯一一件事是高度自我监控的人（适应受众，因此灵活性高、诚信度较低）和低度自我监控的人之间的区别时，引起了我的注意。无论好坏，他们都无法适应自己的受众，因此诚信度很高，灵活性较低。

I’m a high self-monitor, and I started noticing that many couples consist of a high self-monitor and a low self-monitor. Two high self-monitors can find themselves constantly adjusting to each other, and it’s exhausting. Two low self-monitors are slightly hard to seat next to each other at a dinner party; they need a guide for the social world, and often implicitly require the other person to come to them a bit.   
我是一个高度自我监控的人，我开始注意到许多夫妻都由高度自我监控和低度自我监控组成。两个高度自我监控的人会发现自己不断地互相调整，这让人筋疲力尽。在晚宴上，两个自我监控能力较低的人很难坐在一起。他们需要社交世界的指导，并且常常含蓄地要求对方稍微来找他们。

**Big Five or OCEAN 五巨头或海洋**

When I started East Rock 15 years ago, my mission was to find and invest with the most talented investors in the world. I got a piece of advice from a psychology professor who said that I should check out the “Big Five” or OCEAN (Open-minded, Conscientious, Extroverted, Agreeable, Neurotic) Big Five aspect scale. I got distracted and found my way back to the Big Five over 4,000 interviews later; I found it a revelation to help explain the patterns I had soaked up along the way. In retrospect, maybe I needed the large sample size to be able to see how useful the Big Five actually is in describing the nuance of how people behave in real life.  
15 年前，当我创立 East Rock 时，我的使命是寻找世界上最有才华的投资者并与他们一起投资。我从一位心理学教授那里得到了一条建议，他说我应该看看“大五”或海洋（开放的、认真的、外向的、宜人的、神经质的）大五方面量表。我心烦意乱，在 4,000 多次面试后又回到了五巨头；我发现它有助于解释我一路走来所吸收的模式。回想起来，也许我需要大量样本才能看到“五巨头”在描述人们在现实生活中行为方式的细微差别方面实际上有多么有用。

Each personality system has an origin story, and the Big Five’s is particularly credible. Two professors took every word in the English language that could be used to describe someone, put them into categories, and reduced them to as small a set of factors as they could. For instance, if lots of people agreed they could call someone both gregarious and outgoing, the researchers decided that was the same thing; they kept reducing that down until they got extraversion as a primary factor.  
每个人格系统都有一个起源故事，五巨头的起源故事尤其可信。两位教授收集了英语中每一个可以用来描述某人的单词，将它们分类，然后将它们简化为尽可能小的一组因素。例如，如果很多人都同意他们可以称某人既合群又外向，那么研究人员就会认为这是同一件事；他们不断减少这一点，直到他们将外向性作为主要因素。

Researchers later identified that the Big Five could be reduced to the “big two,” stability and plasticity. Or double click on the big Five and you have the “big ten.” Here’s a great overview of the facets:   
研究人员后来发现，五大因素可以简化为“两大因素”：稳定性和可塑性。或者双击“大五”，您就会看到“大十”。以下是各个方面的精彩概述：

![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/400x177,stMziZT20wD3LP6d2Ml5NXI_KRbt6BS6NPcEXRBlcTao/https://h4v1d0.a2cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stability-plasticity-300x132.png)

There are thousands of studies using the Big Five. Within psychology it’s the equivalent of gravity, and at this point nearly everyone in academia finds it a useful mental model for personality. Sam Barondes’ book[ Making Sense of People](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B0050JKCI6&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref%5F=cm%5Fsw%5Fr%5Fkb%5Fdp%5Fd.eqFbZZGF0S6) is a great introduction to the Big Five. I tracked down Sam and asked him about the book’s raison d’être. He told me that he wrote it because he knew the Big Five was solid as science but had noticed that, in his own hiring in the medical department at UCSF as well as among the fancy tech CEOs he counseled, no one was actually using it in practice.  
有数以千计的研究使用“大五”。在心理学中，它相当于重力，在这一点上，学术界几乎每个人都发现它是一个有用的人格心理模型。萨姆·巴伦德斯 (Sam Barondes) 的书《理解人》是对五巨头的精彩介绍。我找到了萨姆，并向他询问这本书存在的理由。他告诉我，他写这本书是因为他知道五巨头作为科学是可靠的，但他注意到，在他自己在 UCSF 医疗部门的招聘以及他所咨询的高级科技首席执行官中，没有人真正在实践。

**ghSMART** 

Ten years ago, I read Geoff Smart’s book[ Who](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B001EL6RWY&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref%5F=cm%5Fsw%5Fr%5Fkb%5Fdp%5FY.eqFb7F2JJ1V) and then hired one of his partners at their assessment firm ghSMART to “Smart” me (a four-hour structured interview) so that I could be on the receiving end of the process and understand it better. Then I had lunch with Geoff, and he somehow managed to grok me within five minutes, hypnotizing me into answering a rapid series of questions with a very upbeat attitude and smile.   
十年前，我读了杰夫·斯马特（Geoff Smart）的书《谁》（Who），然后聘请了他在评估公司 ghSMART 的一位合伙人来“智能”我（四小时的结构化面试），以便我能够成为整个流程的接收端并理解它更好的。然后我和杰夫共进午餐，他不知怎么地在五分钟内就迷惑了我，催眠我以非常乐观的态度和微笑回答了一系列快速问题。

Signature ghSMART questions include the aggressive and efficient question of “what are the names of your last five bosses (stop and write each name down) and when I call them for a reference on you, how would they each rate you on a 1-100 for overall performance?” Interviewers go through each year or phase of your life and capture high points and low points. It sounds easy; it’s not, which is why I assume ghSMART shares all their IP surprisingly freely. If you’re a board member or private equity investor who is hiring someone that is senior and expensive, so the stakes are high and you’re in a hurry, my view is that it’s smart to pay for the services of ghSMART.   
ghSMART 的标志性问题包括激进且高效的问题，即“你最近的五位老板的名字是什么（停下来写下每个名字），当我打电话给他们询问你的情况时，他们每个人会如何评价你（1-100 分）”为了整体表现？”面试官会经历你人生的每一年或每一阶段，捕捉高潮和低谷。听起来很容易；事实并非如此，这就是为什么我认为 ghSMART 令人惊讶地自由地分享他们所有的知识产权。如果您是董事会成员或私募股权投资者，正在雇用资深且昂贵的人员，因此风险很高并且您很匆忙，我的观点是为 ghSMART 的服务付费是明智的。

Pulling the Geoff Smart thread also led me to his father, Brad Smart, who had run a lot of hiring for GE under Jack Welch. Brad’s book[ Topgrading](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B0074VTH02&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref%5F=cm%5Fsw%5Fr%5Fkb%5Fdp%5FfifqFbT3834ZC) inspires much of Geoff’s work. In this[ short blog piece](https://topgrading.com/resources/blog/topgradings-important-competency/), Brad argues that “resourcefulness” is the meta competency:   
拉动杰夫·斯马特的线索还让我找到了他的父亲布拉德·斯马特，他在杰克·韦尔奇的领导下为通用电气负责过大量的招聘工作。布拉德（Brad）的书《顶级分级》（Topgrading）启发了杰夫（Geoff）的大部分工作。在这篇简短的博客文章中，布拉德认为“足智多谋”是元能力：

_Resourcefulness is the single most important competency, so here’s my advice: look for evidence of Resourcefulness 100% of the time as you evaluate candidates. Imagine that you have special magical glasses that register through the lens whether the candidate is, at this moment, revealing Resourcefulness and maybe then it flashes green, or lack of Resourcefulness and maybe then it flashes red. I’m making the point that Resourcefulness is not a competency you first think of after the interview while you’re reviewing your notes. You must constantly ask yourself, “Does that example, what I’m seeing, what I’m feeling, what I’m hearing, show Resourcefulness, or lack of it?”_ 
_足智多谋是最重要的一项能力，所以我的建议是：在评估候选人时，100% 寻找足智多谋的证据。想象一下，你有一个特殊的神奇眼镜，可以通过镜片记录候选人此时是否表现出足智多谋，然后它可能会闪烁绿色，或者缺乏足智多谋，然后它可能会闪烁红色。我想说的是，足智多谋并不是你在面试后复习笔记时首先想到的一种能力。你必须不断地问自己：“这个例子，我所看到的、我所感受到的、我所听到的，是否表现出了足智多谋，还是缺乏足智多谋？”_

I sometimes imagine I’ve dropped the candidate I’m interviewing on a desert island and I come back five years later. Some people I’d worry about, some people I wouldn’t. The Y Combinator application question “what’s a system or game you’ve hacked in the last year?” is a good arrow in the quiver when exploring the resourcefulness dimension.  
有时我会想象我把正在面试的候选人丢到了荒岛上，五年后我又回来了。有些人我会担心，有些人我不会。 Y Combinator 申请问题“您去年破解过的系统或游戏是什么？”在探索足智多谋的维度时，这是一支好箭。

**“Humble, hungry and smart”** 
**“谦虚、饥饿、聪明”**

Another framework I use specifically in the context of hiring for a well-functioning team is former Bain consultant Patrick Lencioni’s idea of “humble, hungry and smart” as the core virtues of the “ideal team player.” Lencioni defines “smart” as “smart about people,” and he notes that if you sacrifice any of these essential three virtues, you are introducing friction into your team. I find his framework quite useful for understanding trade-offs around team dynamics. The book[ The Ideal Team Player](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B01B6AEJJ0&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref%5F=cm%5Fsw%5Fr%5Fkb%5Fdp%5FibfqFbPGSD3SF) is a great quick read, or you can watch this[ TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/patrick%5Flencioni%5Fare%5Fyou%5Fan%5Fideal%5Fteam%5Fplayer) or listen to[ this podcast](https://www.tablegroup.com/hub/post/2-stop-hiring-the-wrong-people/)  
我在招聘运作良好的团队时专门使用的另一个框架是前贝恩顾问帕特里克·伦西奥尼（Patrick Lencioni）的想法，即“谦虚、饥饿和聪明”作为“理想团队成员”的核心美德。伦西奥尼将“聪明”定义为“对人聪明”，他指出，如果你牺牲这三个基本美德中的任何一个，你就会给你的团队带来摩擦。我发现他的框架对于理解团队动态的权衡非常有用。 《理想团队合作者》这本书非常适合快速阅读，或者您也可以观看此 TED 演讲或收听此播客.

Three other frameworks that are often used in a corporate context are[ Caliper](https://calipercorp.com/caliper-profile/),[ Insights Discovery](https://www.insights.com/us/products/insights-discovery/), and[ Workplace Dimensions](https://internalchange.com/order-profiles-training-materials/non-disc-products/team-dimensions-profile/team-dimensions-profile-2-0-online/). Many hedge funds use Caliper as a personality test for hiring (it also has an IQ component) and end up finding it useful. Vista Private Equity has a strategy of buying software businesses and then firing the more expensive, senior software sales people and hiring younger, cheaper ones using Insights Discovery’s ability to successfully identify good sales people (Insights Discovery is based on Jungian archetypes). Ray Dalio and his team at Bridgewater swear by Workplace Dimensions as a way to make sure each small team is balanced and effective across four dimensions: Creator, Refiner, Executer, Advancer.  
在企业环境中经常使用的其他三个框架是 CaliperInsights Discovery 和 Workplace Dimensions。许多对冲基金使用 Caliper 作为招聘的性格测试（它也有智商成分），最终发现它很有用。 Vista Private Equity 的战略是购买软件业务，然后解雇价格更高的高级软件销售人员，并利用 Insights Discovery 成功识别优秀销售人员的能力（Insights Discovery 基于荣格原型）雇用更年轻、更便宜的销售人员。 Ray Dalio 和他在 Bridgewater 的团队坚信工作场所维度是确保每个小团队在四个维度上保持平衡和高效的一种方式：创造者、精炼者、执行者、推进者。

I suspect that each of these systems captures roughly 80% of the reality about people, and the important step for teams is to pick one, invest the time in making the vocabulary resonate, and then use it to discuss communication in the team and make hires.  
我怀疑这些系统中的每一个都捕获了大约 80% 的关于人们的现实，团队的重要一步是选择一个，花时间让词汇产生共鸣，然后用它来讨论团队中的沟通并进行聘用。

**Bob Kegan and the Enneagram** 
**鲍勃·基根和九型人格**

There are two more philosophical systems—Bob Kegan’s adult development scale and the Enneagram—that I frequently try to apply, but they both require big time investments up front in attending workshops and soaking up the vocabulary, so just reading about them can be off-putting and not super useful. I’ll mention both briefly in case people want to investigate further.  
还有另外两个哲学体系——鲍勃·凯根的成人发展量表和九型人格——我经常尝试应用它们，但它们都需要预先投入大量时间参加研讨会和吸收词汇，所以仅​​仅阅读它们可能会让人大吃一惊——投入并不是超级有用。如果人们想进一步调查，我将简要提及两者。

In 2011, I took a[ workshop](https://mindsatwork.com/programs-services/coach-development/subject-object-interview-training/) at the Harvard School of Education to learn how to assess people’s stage of development using Kegan’s Subject Object Interview. Kegan argues that there are five distinct stages of adult development; the last three are the “socialized” stage (around 60% adults are in this stage), the “self-authoring” stage (roughly 30% of American adults), and finally the self-transforming stage (less than 1% of adults). He writes:   
2011年，我参加了哈佛大学教育学院的一个研讨会，学习如何使用基根的主客访谈来评估人们的发展阶段。凯根认为，成人发展有五个不同的阶段：最后三个阶段是“社会化”阶段（大约60％的成年人处于这个阶段），“自我创作”阶段（大约30％的美国成年人），最后是自我转变阶段（不到1％的成年人） ）。他写：

_Having a socialized mind dramatically influences the sending and receiving of information at work. If this is the level of mental complexity through which I view the world, then what I send will be strongly influenced by what I believe others want to hear._ 
_拥有社交思维会极大地影响工作中信息的发送和接收。如果这是我看待世界的心理复杂程度，那么我发送的内容将受到我认为其他人想听到的内容的强烈影响。_ 

_Contrast this with the self-authoring mind. If I view the world from this level of mental complexity, what I “send” is more likely to be a function of what I deem others need to hear to best further the agenda or mission of my design. Consciously or unconsciously, I have a direction, an agenda, a stance, a strategy, an analysis of what is needed, a prior context from which my communication arises. The self-authoring mind creates a filter for what it will allow to come through. It places a priority on receiving the information it has sought. Information I haven’t asked for, and which does not have obvious relevance to my own design for action, has a much tougher time making it through my filter._ 
_将此与自我创作的思维进行对比。如果我从这种心理复杂性的角度看待世界，我“发送”的内容更有可能是我认为其他人需要听到的内容的函数，以最好地推进我的设计的议程或使命。有意识或无意识地，我有一个方向、一个议程、一个立场、一个策略、对需要什么的分析、我的沟通产生的先验背景。自我创作的思维会为它允许通过的内容创建一个过滤器。它优先考虑接收它所寻求的信息。我没有要求的信息，以及与我自己的行动设计没有明显相关性的信息，要通过我的过滤器要困难得多。_ 

_The self-transforming mind both values and is wary about any one stance, analysis, or agenda. It is mindful that, powerful though a given design might be, this design almost inevitably leaves something out. It is aware that it lives in time and that the world is in motion, and what might have made sense today may not make as much sense tomorrow. Therefore, when communicating, people with self-transforming minds are not only advancing their agenda and design, they are also inquiring about the design itself. Information sending is not just on behalf of driving; it is also to remake the map or reset the direction._ 
_自我转变的头脑既重视任何一种立场、分析或议程，又保持警惕。值得注意的是，尽管给定的设计可能很强大，但这种设计几乎不可避免地会遗漏一些东西。它意识到它生活在时间中，世界在运动，今天可能有意义的事情明天可能就不再那么有意义了。因此，具有自我转变思维的人在交流时，不仅是在推进自己的议程和设计，更是在追问设计本身。信息发送不仅仅代表驾驶；也是重新制作地图或者重置方向。_ 

I find Kegan’s framework useful to understand someone’s transition from a role player to an “owner.” I spoke with a former portfolio manager who told an interesting story about his own development. At his former firm, he had been doing well and was surprised when a colleague got a ton more money and responsibility. He was feeling frustrated needing to have the CIO sign off on the positions in his book. The CIO would hem and haw, say he was going to call his friend to see what he thought, etc. Another colleague counseled him, “You’re not owning it. You see this as your job and you try and if it doesn’t work to get one of your positions in the portfolio, oh well. It’s your responsibility to figure out the CIO and what his lens is and convince him to put something in the book.” My friend said that single piece of advice changed his life. Through the Kegan lens, he made a rapid phase shift from “socialized” to “self-authoring.”   
我发现基根的框架对于理解某人从角色扮演者到“所有者”的转变很有用。我采访了一位前投资组合经理，他讲述了一个关于他自己发展的有趣故事。在他以前的公司，他一直表现得很好，当一位同事得到更多的钱和责任时，他感到很惊讶。他对需要 CIO 批准他书中的职位感到沮丧。首席信息官会支支吾吾，说他要打电话给他的朋友，看看他的想法等等。另一位同事劝告他，“你不拥有它。你认为这是你的工作，你会尝试，如果在投资组合中获得你的职位之一不起作用，哦，好吧。你有责任了解 CIO 和他的视角，并说服他在书中写下一些内容。”我的朋友说，一条建议改变了他的生活。通过凯根的视角，他迅速从“社交化”转向“自我创作”。

I often return to Bill Torbert’s[ Global Leadership Profile](https://www.gla.global/the-glp/levels-of-leadership-development/) as a good working articulation of the Kegan levels.   
我经常回顾比尔·托伯特（Bill Torbert）的《全球领导力简介》，作为对基根水平的良好工作阐述。

In 2015, I read Jim Dethmer’s book _The Fifteen Commitments of Conscious Leadership_ and brought him to speak at two hedge fund conferences I had convened. Jim and his partners at the[ Conscious Leadership Group](https://conscious.is/) use the Enneagram a lot in their coaching. The Enneagram is more a tool for personal and spiritual growth than a personality framework per se. I bounced off the Enneagram for the first several years of exposure to it through working with Jim as a coach, finding it obtuse at best and astrological at worst.   
2015年，我读了吉姆·德特默（Jim Dethmer）的书《自觉领导力的十五项承诺》，并邀请他在我召集的两次对冲基金会议上发表演讲。吉姆和他在意识领导小组的合作伙伴在指导中经常使用九型人格。九型人格更多的是个人和精神成长的工具，而不是人格框架本身。在吉姆作为教练的帮助下，我在接触九型人格的最初几年中摆脱了它，发现它往好里说是迟钝的，往坏了说是占星学的。

But over time, I’ve come to appreciate how the patterns seem to hold up oddly well across my sample of people. I particularly like how each of the nine personality types holds the paradox of the gift of that type right next to a profound blind spot for that type. At first I thought my own dominant ego pattern was the 7 pattern (“the enthusiast”), now I think it’s more likely a 3 (“the performer”). I don’t particularly feel the need to resolve which I am, and like having both patterns clear in my mind so that I can be more likely to recognize when I’m in that particular personality groove.  
但随着时间的推移，我开始意识到这些模式在我的人群样本中似乎出奇地有效。我特别喜欢这九种人格类型中的每一种都持有该类型天赋的悖论，紧邻该类型的深刻盲点。起初我认为我自己的主导自我模式是 7 模式（“狂热者”），现在我认为它更有可能是 3（“表演者”）。我并不特别觉得有必要去解决我是谁，并且喜欢在我的脑海中清楚地了解这两种模式，这样我就更有可能认识到我何时处于那种特定的人格状态。

Russ Hudson is one of the preeminent Enneagram thinkers, and his [podcast](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/russ-hudson/) with Shane Parrish is a good place to start. For people who want to go down this particular rabbit hole, I recommend one of Russ’s workshops. It’s hard to see your own pattern at first, so I suggest keeping a parent or significant other in mind as you read the book to see whether you find the framework credible in how it describes someone you know well.  
拉斯·哈德森 (Russ Hudson) 是杰出的九型人格思想家之一，他与肖恩·帕里什 (Shane Parrish) 的播客是一个很好的起点。对于那些想要深入了解这个特殊兔子洞的人，我推荐 Russ 的一个研讨会。一开始很难看到你自己的模式，所以我建议你在阅读这本书时记住你的父母或其他重要的人，看看你是否认为这个框架在描述你熟悉的人时是否可信。

The risk of becoming too steeped in any one framework is you start to be “subject” to that framework, you can only look through its lens, not at the lens. I recommend trying to hold a handful of frameworks in your mind simultaneously in order to maintain flexibility.   
过于沉迷于任何一个框架的风险是你开始“受制于”那个框架，你只能透过它的镜头看，而不是镜头本身。我建议您尝试同时在脑海中保留几个框架，以保持灵活性。

**REFERENCE GUIDE 参考指南**

This is a short note I wrote to myself and a teammate that we re-read before starting a reference process on someone.  
这是我写给自己和队友的简短说明，在开始对某人进行参考过程之前，我们会重新阅读它。

* There are two kinds of information: public information and private information. Our personal assessments of our peers and former employees are firmly in the bucket of private information. That’s both what makes references valuable, and what makes them hard to get.  
信息有两种：公共信息和私人信息。我们对同事和前雇员的个人评估严格保密。这既是参考文献有价值的原因，也是参考文献难以获得的原因。
* Your mission is to collect as many private assessments on your candidate as possible.  
您的任务是收集尽可能多的对候选人的私人评估。
* Remind yourself that your base case is that you will not proceed with the candidate despite the fact you’re at the stage of doing references. You want to create a default mindset that listening to the references is going to actively make you change your mind to make the hire. “Let the references speak” is our mantra.  
提醒自己，你的基本情况是，尽管你正处于做推荐的阶段，但你不会继续与候选人合作。你想要建立一种默认的心态，即倾听推荐人会积极地让你改变主意来雇用。 “让参考文献说话”是我们的座右铭。
* For each candidate there is often one reference that is the motherlode, the Yoda reference—the unbiased, calibrated, no bullshit, clear-eyed reference, someone with “acerbic good taste” who has experienced your candidate with limited ego baggage of their own and is willing to transfer that private information to you. Sometimes you get them on the first call, sometimes it’s on the 20th call. Have you found that reference giver yet? If not and the context permits, do not proceed with the hire, allow yourself to hold the uncertainty.  
对于每一位候选人来说，通常都有一个参考资料，那就是母脉，即尤达参考资料——公正、经过校准、没有废话、目光敏锐的参考资料，具有“尖酸刻薄的品味”的人，他经历过你的候选人，但他们的自我包袱有限，并且愿意将该私人信息转移给您。有时你会在第一个电话上接到他们，有时会在第 20 个电话上接到他们。您找到那个推荐人了吗？如果不是，并且情况允许，请不要继续雇用，让自己承担不确定性。
* Assess whether the reference giver is calibrated—what’s their sample size and do they actually know what excellence in this role is? (Assume 80% of people are not calibrated on the Michael Jordan of this thing.)  
评估推荐人是否经过校准——他们的样本量是多少，他们是否真的知道这个角色的卓越之处是什么？ （假设 80% 的人没有对这个东西的迈克尔·乔丹进行校准。）
* Assess whether you find the reference givers themselves credible. Identify any biases. Would you hire the reference givers or want to work for them? If not, make sure you weight the content of the reference slightly lower.  
评估您是否认为推荐人本身可信。找出任何偏见。您会雇用推荐人还是想为他们工作？如果没有，请确保参考文献的内容权重稍微降低。
* Try to mess with the expected “script” of a reference conversation, where the reference giver reads a LinkedIn testimonial and you read from a check-list of questions. Skim the questions below in advance in order to have them in mind, but try not to read from the list because it creates a different dynamic, more interrogation and less creative exploration and appreciation of someone’s idiosyncrasies.  
尝试打乱推荐人对话的预期“脚本”，其中推荐人阅读LinkedIn推荐信，而你则阅读问题清单。提前浏览下面的问题，以便将它们牢记在心，但尽量不要阅读列表中的内容，因为它会产生不同的动力，更多的审问和更少的创造性探索和对某人特质的欣赏。
* The dog that doesn’t bark is the hardest thing to assess and requires calibration / a big sample size —what could they say on the positive side but are not saying?  
不叫的狗是最难评估的，需要校准/大样本量——他们可以说积极的一面但没有说什么呢？
* Do references in person if you can, Zoom is second best, phone is third best.  
如果可以的话，亲自做参考，Zoom 是第二好的，电话是第三好的。
* Start with an opener that makes it safe to convey private information: “Thanks for taking the time. I’m trying to find the right seat for Jane and I’m investing the time in speaking to people who know her. Everything you say will be off the record, and I don’t plan on conveying any of it back to Jane.”  
从一个可以安全地传达私人信息的开场白开始：“感谢您抽出时间。我正在努力为简找到合适的座位，并花时间与认识她的人交谈。你所说的一切都不会被记录下来，我也不打算将任何内容传达给简。”
