**Good morning.** If you read the Wikipedia article on the [Ship of Theseus](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/flX?mblid=a2286fbc12f6&mbcid=33726137.4070521&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), you’ll learn that it’s a philosophical thought experiment that raises the question: If all of the components of an original object are gradually replaced, is it still the same object? The ancient Greeks first pondered this after a ship belonging to Theseus was replaced part by part over centuries until none of the original material was left.

Well, how’s this for a meta-twist: As Depths of Wikipedia [discovered](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/flY?mblid=8aa92995b798&mbcid=33726137.4070521&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), the Wikipedia page for the Ship of Theseus, which first appeared in 2003, has been edited over time, and now _none_ of the phrases from the original article remain.

Is it still the same Wikipedia article?

The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office on Friday ruled the drowning death of _Friends_ star Matthew Perry in October was due to “the acute effects of ketamine.” The 54-year-old Perry battled addiction for decades and detailed in his memoir how he was using ketamine as part of his treatment for depression and anxiety.

Now Perry’s death, which was also determined to be an accident, has put [greater attention](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fm0?mblid=353802ed39e9&mbcid=33726137.4070521&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) on ketamine, a drug that has proven to be an effective mental health treatment but poses risks in recreational and unregulated settings.

## Ketamine’s journey to health aid

The drug’s origins date to the 1970s as an injectable anesthetic for humans and animals. It took a circuitous route to becoming a breakthrough treatment for mental health.

* In the 1990s, ketamine—known as “Special K”—emerged as a popular party drug thanks to its hallucinogenic qualities.
* In 1999, it became a Schedule III nonnarcotic substance under the Controlled Substances Act. Schedule III drugs are defined by the Drug Enforcement Administration as having a “moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.”
* In 2006, researchers at the National Institutes of Health showed that an intravenous dose of ketamine could relieve severe depression in a matter of hours.
* In 2019, the FDA approved a nasal spray called esketamine, which is derived from ketamine and used for treatment-resistant depression.

The main difference between medicinal and recreational use of ketamine is the dosage, which is much higher when it’s used as an anesthetic or illicitly.

## The dangers of home use

Esketamine must be administered by a healthcare professional in a clinical setting. Perry’s autopsy report said the ketamine in his system could not have been from his last known ketamine therapy session, which was about a week and a half before he died.

Online providers started prescribing ketamine for home use during the pandemic, thanks to relaxed federal rules on remote prescriptions. Although ketamine overdoses are rare, the drug’s ability to render a subject unconscious with too high of a dose without supervision has led to accidental deaths.

**Big picture:** Investors have [written big checks](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fm1?mblid=45e775702369&mbcid=33726137.4070521&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to startups aiming to treat mental illness with psychedelics, and Silicon Valley elites such as Elon Musk [reportedly use](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baO?mblid=e07fc7baccb1&mbcid=33726137.4070521&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) ketamine, LSD, and other mind-expanding drugs recreationally. Dr. Gerard Sanacora, director of Yale University’s depression-research program, told the WSJ that Perry’s death “should be a wake-up call that ketamine needs to be used appropriately.”—_DL_

Eight others in connection with Becciu, who had been considered a candidate to be the next pope, were also found guilty of financial crimes or abuse of office. Prosecutors discovered money transfers as part of a London real estate deal approved by Becciu in 2013 and 2014; the court found that the transactions were embezzlement and ordered the guilty parties to pay the Vatican more than $200 million in restitution. The ruling can be seen as a win for Pope Francis, who was elected in 2013 with a mandate to reform the church.

“So far all of the signals we’re getting lead to an intentional act on the part of someone in the supply chain,” the FDA’s Deputy Commissioner for Human Foods Jim Jones told Politico last Thursday. The investigation is zeroing in on a single manufacturing facility in Ecuador with links to the cinnamon applesauce pouches sold under three brands—Weis, WanaBana, and Schnucks—which were recalled in November.

**What is food fraud?** It’s when a producer manipulates ingredients in a food product to gain a competitive edge (think: “watering” down olive oil with cheaper vegetable oil). This type of fraud could cost the global food industry up to $40 billion a year, according to some estimates.

**And why do it with applesauce?** The _[cinnamon](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fma?mblid=41b8e03b0ed8&mbcid=33726137.4070521&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)_ is the key. Lead can be added to spices with a reddish hue to increase weight (making them pricier) or to make the red color more vibrant, food safety experts told the NYT.

**Big picture:** The FDA does not currently test for lead in food imported to, or made in, the US, which critics say leaves kids who eat these products as guinea pigs.—_NF_

## [ Key performance indicators ](#) 

![A Harvard University building](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,sssQ4s5UiWsOOk5cKkxKp_CS2GktfZwywXoNxzNJ2OBQ/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/078f93f889ac630e1406668668faf1d9967a0ddb-1434x1090.png?w=668&q=70&auto=format) _Harvard University_ 

**Stat:** Has Harvard lost its luster? Early admission applications to Harvard [dropped 17%](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fmh?mblid=e1e56dff2fc5&mbcid=33726137.4070521&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) this year to their lowest levels in four years, the school revealed last week. Meanwhile, Yale’s early applications increased 1.4%, and UPenn reported a more than 6% increase. Applications were due on Nov. 1, over a month before three university presidents, including Harvard’s and UPenn’s, gave widely criticized testimony at a congressional hearing on antisemitism. This is also the first enrollment period since the Supreme Court banned race-based admissions (affirmative action) in higher education.

**Quote:** “We just suck at putting.”

That harsh criticism comes from 14-year-old [Charlie Woods](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fmi?mblid=3d86a1d5c7cb&mbcid=33726137.4070521&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) about himself and his father, Tiger, who has made one or two putts during his legendary career. The duo shot 8-under 64 Saturday at the PNC Championship, a team event featuring major champions and their family members. Though Charlie felt like the day could have gone better, Tiger was euphoric to have his kids on the course—not only was he competing with his son, but his daughter, Sam, caddied for him for the first time.

## State map

A US state recently selected a new flag, and the five designs below were the finalists. What state is this?

For bonus points: Can you guess which design was selected for the new flag?

![State flag finalist designs](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,scQMEkf3t8chzGnCeBFbqcS1LYji3bsPuWlOBNI9RJpE/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/d37f710d4695649c1eb542c517c0f60a54e882d9-1600x803.png?w=668&q=70&auto=format) 

### ANSWER

Minnesota. And the design in the lower left-hand corner (the star with the three stripes) will be the new flag. Good choice?
