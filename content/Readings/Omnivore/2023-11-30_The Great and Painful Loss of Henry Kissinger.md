Henry Kissinger was the most extraordinary man I knew and a very special friend, so I feel his passing deeply and I have the deepest empathy for those who were closest to him, especially for Nancy because they had such a loving relationship for fifty years. ==Henry was and will remain a hero of mine, and many others, in an era of great cynicism when we no longer have heroes in public life.== Why do I say he was a great hero? Here are some of the facts.

==He had an unparalleled perspective. No living person had simultaneously studied history as deeply, been as profoundly involved in shaping it, known personally and influenced as many world leaders, and more generously shared meaningful insights than Henry Kissinger.== He was blessed by a unique ability to see things through all relevant parties’ eyes and think strategically about where they would likely go or should likely go. Until his end, he had a multidimensional understanding that extended from ancient times through the most contemporary developments in geopolitics, artificial intelligence, and other elements of human behavior.

These facts should be apparent to any sensible person who has read Henry’s books or talked with him, which I have been fortunate to have done frequently. I personally learned an enormous amount from Henry and have come to adore him because he has generously shared his extraordinary perspective with me and with so many others. I also loved his wit. I was blessed to enjoy the gift of a wonderful relationship with this great man whom I have admired for most of my life. ==We shared a passion for history and for understanding what is happening now, but from different perspectives learned through our different experiences—his from the geopolitical and mine from the economic.== He was also very warm and considerate. For example, when I had a great personal loss, he went out of his way to help console me. Even at 100, he was still contributing to global affairs and was deeply engaged in some of the most important topics of our time.

While losing him is a very painful loss, our having had him in such good shape for over a hundred years was a great gift.
