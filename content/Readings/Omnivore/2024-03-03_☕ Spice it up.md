## Careers

BARTENDER W/ GOOD BALANCE: An 18th-century pub famous for its slanted stature in the English village of Himley burned down last year. The town‚Äôs city council said it can be [rebuilt](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hUd?mblid=4db2a7ab9042&mbcid=34535700.3882919&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)‚Äîas long as its structure stays wonky.

The simple vanilla plus chocolate frozen treat was supplanted by consumers‚Äô love of ‚Äúpremium‚Äù flavors like cookie dough and salted caramel.

SNAKE-ATION: Every spring, the Italian village of Cocullo hosts the [festival of the snake catchers](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hUh?mblid=9fc25ccbbbce&mbcid=34535700.3882919&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), where people carry a statue of San Domenico covered in snakes through the streets.

The event involves a horde of dudes wearing only loincloths and socks participating in various rituals, like running through freezing water. What killed this millennium-old tradition, you ask? Not enough young people to undress and participate.

_Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even curse less._

A group of researchers at the University of Zurich had professional pianists play for 27 different nonmusicians in MRI scanners. The live recitals [stimulated listeners‚Äô brains](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hUp?mblid=7ac5033c16de&mbcid=34535700.3882919&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) more than when they just listened to recordings‚Äîspecifically in the amygdala, the brain‚Äôs emotional center. The researchers pointed out that in live performances, musicians can riff on their songs to engage directly with the audience, which creates a feedback loop that you can‚Äôt get with recordings.

The Danionella cerebrum, a half-inch fish found in Myanmar, can make sounds surpassing 140 decibels, aka as loud as an ambulance or jackhammer. Scientists recorded the fish [sounding like](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hUq?mblid=14d8bda88dad&mbcid=34535700.3882919&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) a swarm of underwater cicadas due to a rib in its body rapidly drumming against cartilage.

## [Are Chinese EVs poised for world domination?](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hUs?mbcid=34535700.3882919&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)

People have been predicting flying cars for the past century, but what no one had on their bingo card was China making cars that foreigners actually want to buy. Chinese automakers traditionally sold most of their vehicles at home, struggling to compete overseas with the likes of Ford, Volkswagen, and Toyota.

But as more drivers go electric, budget-friendly cars from Chinese EV-makers are becoming a common sight on roads worldwide. The country grew its EV exports by 851% in the past three years, with surging shipments to Europe, per the NYT.

Meanwhile, internationally established auto brands selling pricier EVs are beginning to feel like they‚Äôre getting cut off at an intersection.

## Tesla‚Äôs nightmare

The splashiest Chinese EV brand is the Warren Buffett-backed BYD, which has experienced a meteoric rise that was unthinkable just a few years ago: 

* In 2011, Elon Musk [laughed out loud](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hUt?mblid=74d16ff3152b&mbcid=34535700.3882919&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) when a Bloomberg reporter asked him to share his thoughts on the company, responding, ‚ÄúHave you seen their car?‚Äù
* Fast forward 13 years and Musk is no longer giggling: BYD surpassed Tesla in the final quarter of 2023 as the world‚Äôs largest EV seller.
* Musk recently warned Tesla investors that Chinese carmakers will ‚Äúdemolish‚Äù their foreign competitors unless countries establish trade barriers.

Tesla is now scrambling to compete by cutting prices and aiming to release what it says will be its cheapest model sometime next year. But in a mirror move, BYD, seemingly after Tesla‚Äôs luxury market, introduced a [swagged-out](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hUu?mblid=a29ca7a3ba5e&mbcid=34535700.3882919&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) $233,000 Lamborghini-style supercar and an SUV that floats in water and rotates 360 degrees.

It‚Äôs not just Tesla losing sleep: BYD also took Volkswagen‚Äôs No. 1 spot as the best-selling car brand in China last year, and it plans to set up shop in the German carmaker‚Äôs backyard with its first factory in Europe.

## Western governments are worried, too

Last week, President Biden directed the Commerce Department to investigate what threats Chinese EVs may pose to Americans‚Äô data.

But while Biden likened modern cars to ‚Äúsmartphones on wheels,‚Äù a Chinese EV tracking how much time you spend at the McD‚Äôs drive-through is probably not the only concern. With the president up for reelection, the move is widely seen as a first step to prevent an American automakers‚Äô apocalypse on their home turf.

Biden said he thinks China is trying to dominate the world‚Äôs auto market using ‚Äúunfair practices.‚Äô‚Äô He‚Äôs likely referring to generous government subsidies that allowed its carmakers to offer sticker prices that make rival EVs look like a Maserati-level purchase.

The EU is already investigating whether these subsidies abide by trade rules and is considering imposing additional tariffs on Chinese cars.

## So, why aren‚Äôt they on your local roads?

The short answer is trade barriers: The US has a 25% tariff on Chinese EV imports (in addition to the 2.5% duty on all imported cars), and the Biden administration is considering raising it even further, per the WSJ.

However, BYD‚Äôs plan to build factories in Mexico has some US lawmakers concerned it might be an attempt to bypass tariffs. The company denies this, saying last week that it does not plan to send the cars it builds there north of the border. 

**Looking ahead‚Ä¶**even if Chinese EVs end up on US car lots, they might not be the next big thing. They have ‚Äúextremely low‚Äù brand awareness among Americans, and their ‚Äúdurability and safety is middling,‚Äù Spencer Imel of consumer insights company Langston told Reuters._‚ÄîSK_

## [Place to be: The planet Arrakis](#) 

_Dune/Warner Bros._

_It‚Äôs a big world out there. In this section, we‚Äôll teleport you to an interesting location‚Äîand hopefully give you travel ideas in the process._

_Dune: Part 2_, the second installment in the futuristic space saga, opened in theaters this weekend. As is the case with many movies and TV shows, the popularity of _Dune_ is turning Arrakis into a popular travel destination.

Allow us to help you prepare for your trip by answering some FAQs.

**Should I go if I have a sand allergy?**

It‚Äôs a desert planet, so consider packing some Claritin.

**What if I have a worm phobia?**

Strike two. Arrakis is inhabited by 1,200-foot sandworms, although this could be the perfect opportunity to face your fears.

**What if I only speak English?**

Even though Galach is the official language of Arrakis, everyone is either speaking English or subtitled. Fluency in Arabic may have helped in the past, but the current version of Arrakis has [all but erased it](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hUF?mblid=54993d9e086e&mbcid=34535700.3882919&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

**Is it true this planet is best known for a drug?**

Yes. It‚Äôs called melange, street name ‚Äúthe spice.‚Äù

**What does it do?**

It heightens your mental awareness and gives some the ability to see into the future.

**So it‚Äôs like a Four Loko?**

Yes, but with fewer flavors.

**How do I get to Arrakis?**

You‚Äôll need the spice, as its powers allow high-speed interspace travel by showing you obstructions to avoid well in advance, and a spaceship. So check Facebook Marketplace.

**Any touristy things to do?**

Arrakeen, the capital city, has everything to make other travel influencers jealous, from ostentatious buildings to mysterious caves.

**OK, I‚Äôm in. How long does it take to get there?**

You must travel across galaxies, so it will be a protracted journey, but it won‚Äôt feel as long as the first movie._‚ÄîDL_

Last week, we asked: ‚ÄúInstead of a flag, what should the US leave on the moon to signify our visit?‚Äù Here are our favorite answers:

* ‚ÄúA Chili‚Äôs. We won‚Äôt wait so long to go back to the moon if we know we can get a Triple Dipper dinner.‚Äù‚Äî_Nick from Boston, MA_
* ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs fresh on my mind from the special edition of the Brew, but a Reserved parking spot.‚Äù‚Äî_Tom from Pittsburgh, PA_
* ‚ÄúA table with a Monopoly game board in mid-play with a note saying ‚Äòyour turn.‚Äô‚Äù‚Äî_William from Clarks Summit, PA_
* ‚Äú1,776 McRibs.‚Äù‚Äî_Collin from Seattle, WA_
* ‚ÄúSnoopy in his American Sopwith Camel.‚Äù‚Äî_Suzanne from Pennsylvania_
