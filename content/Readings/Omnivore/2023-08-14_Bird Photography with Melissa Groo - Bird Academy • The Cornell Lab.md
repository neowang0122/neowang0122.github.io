– \[Melissa\] I’m crazy for birds. I’m blown away by their exquisite beauty, their diversity, their intelligence, and their close family bonds. For me there’s nothing better than capturing these magnificent creatures with my camera and sharing their beauty and complexity with others.

I’m Melissa Groo, and I’d like to invite you to join me for my course on bird photography. Drawing on my experience as a contributing photographer and writer for Audubon, Smithsonian, and National Geographic, and as a regular columnist for Outdoor Photographer magazine, I want to help you realize your goals no matter how modest or ambitious they are. From figuring out what gear to buy, to finding birds to photograph, to learning how to edit your work, I’ll share with you the best techniques for capturing the majesty of birds.

I’ll teach you how to push beyond your camera’s automatic mode so that you can realize your unique creative vision. And I’m excited to share all my tips for capturing birds in flight, one of the toughest kinds of nature photography out there. Bird photography is about so much more though, it’s also about building naturalist skills that are essential to finding and spending time with the birds that you want to photograph.

The fieldcraft techniques you’ll learn in this course will propel your bird photography to a whole new level, and inspire you to tell powerful stories with your images. I hope you’ll join me for this course; I can’t wait to share this experience with you.
