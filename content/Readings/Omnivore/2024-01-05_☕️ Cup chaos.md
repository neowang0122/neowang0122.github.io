The debate over “wokeness” has thrown the corporate world into turmoil. Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives boomed following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, but now conservative investors and politicians are throwing their weight behind undermining those efforts.

DEI programs existed long before 2020\. In the corporate world, the term refers to initiatives or training that might help create more inclusive workplaces, especially ones that support historically underrepresented groups. Four years ago, many CEOs pledged their commitment to DEI, amping up anti-bias training and hiring like crazy (between 2020 and 2021, DEI-related job postings jumped nearly 30%). The effectiveness of those efforts was occasionally questioned, but there wasn’t a widespread movement to end them.

Now, however, critics are rallying to rescind these policies, going as far as to deem them “reverse racism.” Billionaire investor Bill Ackman posted a 4,000-word roast of DEI efforts to X on Wednesday following the [resignation](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fKg?mblid=c6f20cd203ea&mbcid=33896780.4023559&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of Harvard President Claudine Gay, who is Black.

* Joined in recent days by other prominent critics, Ackman claimed DEI is “the root cause of antisemitism at Harvard.”
* Elon Musk later joined in, reposting Ackman and adding that “DEI is just another word for racism.”
* Mark Cuban, a DEI supporter, [responded to Musk](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fPT?mblid=15d697da05dd&mbcid=33896780.4023559&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), refuting his and Ackman’s claims by arguing that the DEI framework for hiring is in the best interest of business.
* Ackman also called for the resignation of Penny Pritzker, the head of the Harvard Corporation. A Harvard spokesperson said that Pritzker will not be resigning.

Outside of Harvard, Chip Wilson, the highly controversial founder and former CEO of Lululemon, [told](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fPU?mblid=cc35d7db4516&mbcid=33896780.4023559&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) Forbes this week that the company made a mistake by leaning into diverse advertising and that the brand is “not everything to everybody.” Lululemon said his views don’t represent the company’s. 

**What’s the future of DEI in the workplace?** As the country enters a tense election year, [HR experts](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fQh?mblid=f01d588e7107&mbcid=33896780.4023559&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) say they’re devoted to making sure workplaces stay inclusive, but many are [distancing](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fPV?mblid=d2aafb029ff8&mbcid=33896780.4023559&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) themselves from the term DEI—and data suggests some companies are already pivoting. By mid-2023, DEI-related job postings had dropped 44% compared to the prior year, according to data from Indeed, while tech giants like Meta and Google have significantly [scaled back](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fPW?mblid=8359622949ce&mbcid=33896780.4023559&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) diversity programs._—MM_

It was the deadliest attack in Iran since the country’s 1979 revolution. The group did not provide firm proof of its involvement, and its version of events differed from some reports in Iranian media. The attack further stoked fears that the Israel–Hamas war could turn into a wider regional conflict after this week’s assassination of a top Hamas leader in Lebanon, the US launching an airstrike that killed a militia leader in Iraq, and ongoing attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels on commercial ships in the Red Sea.

The 156-page report includes public documents and internal financial records that Democrats obtained in court. More than two-thirds of the total that Trump’s businesses received ($5.5 million) was from China. The report’s release comes as Democrats’ GOP counterparts in the House are attempting to prove that President Biden personally benefited from his family’s foreign business dealings.

Driving the eight-year deal is the women’s March Madness tournament, which accounts for about 57% of the deal, or $65 million annually, according to the NCAA. That’s 10 times what it was valued in ESPN’s prior contract with the association—a jump attributed in no small part to last year’s epic [championship](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fQ1?mblid=792afceb0051&mbcid=33896780.4023559&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) game that brought in a record \~10 million viewers to see stars like Iowa’s Caitlin Clark.

**Also part of the deal…**men’s and women’s tennis, volleyball, and several other sports. Division II and III basketball will also come to ESPN for the first time.

**Zoom out:** Industry execs had speculated that the NCAA might break out women’s basketball in a standalone deal, the way it has with men’s (which has broadcast rights valued at over $1 billion annually), given the sport’s increased revenue and popularity.

**Nut-nut for Stanley cups:** The 40-ounce Stanley “Quencher”—an insulated travel mug that fits in a cup holder—appears to be the new [it product](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fQb?mblid=3e5344fdb5b4&mbcid=33896780.4023559&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) among hydration-obsessed young people, especially women. On TikTok, there are 6.7 billion views on videos tagged #stanleycup (most of which are _not_ about hockey) and nearly 1 billion views for the hashtag #watertok.

The comically enormous Quencher has gotten so popular that it’s largely responsible for Stanley’s revenue jumping from $74 million in 2019 to $750 million in 2023, according to [CNBC](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fQc?mblid=f606074cf88f&mbcid=33896780.4023559&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

According to the agency, last year had the [lowest rate](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fPi?mblid=dc02ecf78075&mbcid=33896780.4023559&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of flight cancellations in a decade. Just 1.2% of the 16.3 million flights in the United States were scratched, down from 2.3% in 2022\. That improvement was partly due to a relatively smooth holiday season, when a mere 0.8% of flights were canceled, well below the 8.2% cancellation rate caused by a big winter storm in 2022\. An ongoing industry hiring boom helped, too: Employment at airlines is now at a two-decade high.
