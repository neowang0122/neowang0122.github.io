**Good morning and Happy New Year!** You’re allowed to say that until January 7, according to Larry David, so use it generously this week while you can.

If it felt like 2023 zipped by, 2024 could be more drawn out. That’s because it’s a leap year, and people who were born on February 29, 2020, can finally turn one.

The 366-day year also means you’ll have to dig out your calendar from 1996 for the most recent match to 2024\. And keep your 2023 calendar in a safe place—you’ll be able to use it again in 2034\. Fun fact: There are only 14 possible calendar configurations.

It’s great to be back!

* **Markets:** The stock market was closed yesterday to give investors time to ~~nurse their hangovers~~ celebrate New Year’s. And 2023 provided plenty of reasons to pop bottles: Global stock markets had their best year since 2019, and all three major US indexes finished the year [higher](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fHw?mblid=cc79b8ffbfdd&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) than they started it, with tech company gains pushing the Nasdaq up the most. Even among tech giants, Nvidia was a standout, boosted by AI suddenly being everywhere.

### CULTURE

## [ The original Mickey is finally free for public use ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fI9?mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) 

[ ![Gif of Mickey Mouse from Steamboat Willy](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,s0Wlu-gKXyzXsAHIyEcica9PuwK80GesgL12lb7GeIcA/https://storage.morningbrew.com/gif/2023-01-06/image-9e2d2cf64c27c4220d41f5c449b3a2a2182f9a09-500x398-gif/slack-imgs.gif) ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fI9?mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) _Steamboat Willie/Disney via Giphy_ 

If you’ve had lifelong dreams of producing a psychological thriller starring Mickey Mouse without getting sued, your time has come: As of yesterday, anyone is allowed to create content featuring the earliest version of Disney’s flagship rodent.

Disney is known for aggressively protecting its intellectual property, but the entertainment giant just had to kiss its exclusive rights to the [original Mickey and Minnie Mouse](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fIa?mblid=33c4cd64c696&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) goodbye. That’s because the company’s 95-year copyright on the 1928 cartoon short _Steamboat Willie,_ in which the characters first appeared, expired as the clock struck midnight on New Year’s Eve.

So, nearly a century after the celebrity couple debuted in black and white, they’re now in the US public domain and free to use, with [some limitations](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aD4?mblid=c0ec9a44c911&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a):

* Only the original versions of Mickey and Minnie, as they appear in _Steamboat Willie_, are up for grabs. Character details introduced in later years, including their white gloves, Mickey’s classic red pants, Minnie’s polka dots, and their high-pitched voice, are off limits.
* Disney still has a registered trademark on _Steamboat Willie_ Mickey as a company mascot, so folks who use the character’s likeness have to make it clear that their project isn’t an official Disney production.

## This could be the year of the NSFW mouse

With OG Mickey finally out of Disney’s copyright clutches, creative types are wasting no time ruining our childhoods.

In a new horror video game [announced yesterday](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fIb?mblid=c6714948e932&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), an unhinged-looking Mickey Mouse hunts players in a dark warehouse. It could be the trickle before the flood: Techdirt is hosting its sixth annual [Public Domain Game Jam](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fIc?mblid=e523d9237e05&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), which encourages people to design games using media that entered the public domain that year.

Noteworthy properties include the stage adaptation of _Peter Pan_ and the second _Winnie-the-Pooh_ book, which introduced Tigger. Now that he’s in the public domain, the bouncing tiger will join his pals in the [sequel](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fIe?mblid=95791a803874&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to [_Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey_](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aD3?mblid=4ed5a0a3f6c8&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), last year’s slasher film featuring Christopher Robin’s free-to-use childhood friends._—ML_

The ruling could reignite Israel’s domestic political disagreements.

The Houthis, who are based in Yemen but backed by Iran, began attacking commercial ships traveling through the Red Sea in November in response to the Israel–Hamas war. Several major shipping groups started taking longer routes around Africa to avoid the area, through which \~12% of global commerce usually flows, but the US has vowed to secure the trade route.

Last week, a previously inconceivable icon emerged from the middle of an Orlando football field—a Pop-Tarts mascot was [ceremonially lowered](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fHW?mblid=ecd78350ea1e&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) into a giant toaster holding a sign that read “Dreams really do come true.” The toaster then produced an [edible](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fHX?mblid=e41700d2a225&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) replica of the mascot for the winning team to eat.

The viral moment took place at the first-ever Pop-Tarts Bowl college football game, and Pop-Tarts considered it a touchdown: Its director of brand marketing said it rivaled “a major [Super Bowl moment](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fHY?mblid=e658dd1438aa&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)” in terms of impact. Despite occurring at an inconsequential college bowl game, the marketing stunt [took over X](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fHZ?mblid=450f0e103b44&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) and actually made people [want](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fH-?mblid=0ad2b1e9a9b9&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) Pop-Tarts.

According to Apex Marketing Group, the Pop-Tarts campaign [generated](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fH%5F?mblid=a5c2b16b6091&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) an estimated $12.1 million worth of media exposure for the company that makes Pop-Tarts, Kellanova, which reportedly paid just $2 million to sponsor the game.

**Zoom out:** With 42 college bowl games between December 16 and January 8, sponsors are becoming increasingly creative to stand out.

**Stat:** While beer is considered as quintessentially American as other German imports like hamburgers and frankfurters, 2023 was a rough year for brewskis in the US. Consumption levels fell to their [lowest in years](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fHN?mblid=167f8a73b0fb&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), as fewer than 200 million barrels were estimated to have been shipped for the first time since 1999, according to Beer Marketer’s Insights. And it wasn’t just the Bud Light boycott taking a bite out of sales, experts told NBC, as beer now has to compete with new sugary alcoholic drinks being marketed to the same drinkers (we see you, Dunkin’ Spiked Coffee).

**Quote:** “I predict that human judges will be around for a while.”

Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court John Roberts [believes](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fHO?mblid=e47ba5723524&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that AI will someday transform how the courts conduct their business…but not just yet. In his year-end [report](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fHP?mblid=01f42ce7fb10&mbcid=33859090.3528843&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), the justice said he thinks AI will change how judges do their jobs but that the machines aren’t coming for their robes anytime soon. Roberts noted that in a trial, “much can turn on a shaking hand, a quivering voice, a change of inflection, a bead of sweat, a moment’s hesitation, a fleeting break in eye contact,” and that most people trust a person rather than AI to interpret those signs.

Word of the Day

Today’s Word of the Day is: inconceivable, meaning “not capable of being imagined.” It’s also a favorite of Vizzini from _The Princess Bride_, but we do not think it means what he thinks it means. Thanks to Paul Biles from Warda, Texas, and several other bold thinkers for the suggestion.
