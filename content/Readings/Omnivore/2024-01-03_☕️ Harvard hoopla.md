**Good morning.** We never thought we’d write this, but you might want to find a way to stream darts this afternoon. That’s because Luke “the Nuke” Littler, a 16-year-old viral phenom who loves eating kebabs, playing Xbox, and chucking sharp objects, will compete in the PDC Darts World Championship final. If he wins, he’d become the youngest darts champion in history by eight years.

Darts has recently exploded in popularity in Europe, and Littler’s storybook run is boosting its profile even more. Littler’s quarterfinal victory reached a peak of 1.4 million viewers, and today’s final will certainly smash that number.

Harvard University President Claudine Gay announced her resignation yesterday following weeks of turmoil resulting from allegations of plagiarism and controversy over her testimony in last month’s congressional hearing regarding antisemitism on college campuses. The Harvard Crimson, the school’s student newspaper, [first reported](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fKh?mblid=3db9a2526513&mbcid=33871682.4009717&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the resignation.

Gay’s six-month tenure was the shortest in the university’s 388-year history. Criticism of her leadership began just a few months into her term when many, including vocal billionaire alumnus Bill Ackman, condemned her response to a controversial statement made by student groups about Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel. 

On December 5, Gay and the presidents of MIT and the University of Pennsylvania appeared before a congressional committee to discuss the rise of antisemitism on campuses. The presidents were [widely panned](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fKi?mblid=1bce1dd9c61a&mbcid=33871682.4009717&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for their refusal to explicitly answer whether “calling for the genocide of Jews” violated their universities’ codes of conduct. Two of the three leaders are now gone: President Liz Magill of Penn resigned on December 10.

## Allegations of plagiarism

Accusations of plagiarism against Gay initially came from the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative outlet, last month. Harvard then conducted an independent review, [finding](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fKj?mblid=49c2986aab39&mbcid=33871682.4009717&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) instances of “inadequate citation” but no research misconduct.

Gay’s supporters have criticized how Harvard’s governing body, the Harvard Corporation, handled the allegations and the backlash against Gay, although it did unanimously reaffirm its support of her presidency on December 12\. In her resignation [letter](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fKk?mblid=a4c0e977be3d&mbcid=33871682.4009717&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), Gay said she’s been subjected to racial vitriol and personal attacks. Gay was the first Black woman to serve as president of Harvard, and her backers say the campaign to oust her was politically motivated.

**Big picture:** The push to remove Gay has sparked a debate around the influence of wealthy donors on university decision-making. Private donations to US colleges and universities last year reached $59.5 billion, up from \~$14.8 billion in 1980–81.

**Looking ahead…**the House Committee on Education & the Workforce is investigating the allegations of plagiarism against Gay. Meanwhile, the Harvard board appointed Alan M. Garber, the university’s provost and chief academic officer, as interim president.—_CC_

Someone get Elon to a FedEx, because he has to ship Tesla’s EV crown to China: For the first time ever, his company sold fewer EVs in a quarter than the Chinese electric car giant BYD, which [claimed the top spot](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fJQ?mblid=8e9f718a7d11&mbcid=33871682.4009717&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for Q4 2023 in all-electric sales.

Tesla still beat expectations with a record quarter (and the 1.8 million EVs it sold in 2023 were the most worldwide for the full year), but it’s now racing bumper-to-bumper with its ascendant overseas rival.

## BYD goes pedal to the floor

The Warren Buffett-backed battery manufacturer turned automaker scaled quickly, partly due to its ability to [mass-produce](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fJR?mblid=c3374ac42a38&mbcid=33871682.4009717&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) its own batteries.

* BYD sold 526,000 all-electric vehicles in the last three months of 2023, compared with Tesla’s 484,500\.
* The company grew its EV sales by 73% year over year, delivering 1.57 million vehicles and selling roughly as many plug-in hybrids, according to Nikkei.

Though BYD still makes nine out of every 10 of its sales within China, its international deliveries grew more than 3x in 2023\. And it’s threatening to pass auto titans Volkswagen and Renault in their own lane with plans for its first European EV plant in Hungary.

**But there are speed bumps…**BYD faces the possibility that Europe will raise tariffs on Chinese electric cars. The EU is also investigating China’s massive subsidies for its EV-makers, which it claims might be artificially lowering prices._—SK_

* Only 14 of the 116 directors (\~12%) of the 100 highest-grossing films of 2023 were women.
* Just four (3.4%) were women of color.

The report skewered Hollywood’s attempt to improve representation as “[performative](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fJX?mblid=0454eef12125&mbcid=33871682.4009717&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).” Another report from San Diego State University found that for the 250 top-earning movies of 2023, the results are even more dire: Just 16% of those directors were women, [down](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fJY?mblid=e2de0eb424e5&mbcid=33871682.4009717&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)[from 18%](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fJY?mblid=e2de0eb424e5&mbcid=33871682.4009717&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in 2022.

**Big picture:** In the wake of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, Hollywood studios said they’d reevaluate their hiring practices and vowed to make the talent in front of and behind the camera look more like the audiences watching. The industry made some strides—a separate USC study found that the percentage of Asian characters in speaking roles has [meaningfully increased](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fJZ?mblid=39747ffa30ca&mbcid=33871682.4009717&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), for instance—but critics argue it’s not doing enough.

**The caveat:** The reports don’t include directors working for streaming services, which typically have better representation than traditional studios. In 2021, nearly 27% of the directors Netflix hired were women._—AE_

**Stat:** Heeding the advice of an _I Think You Should Leave_ sketch closely, billionaire Warren Buffett did a lot of giving in 2023\. The Berkshire Hathaway co-founder donated 1.5 million shares of company stock—worth $541 million—to his Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, which primarily backs women’s reproductive health. That was the [biggest act of charity](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fK1?mblid=6a2308a27c89&mbcid=33871682.4009717&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of the year, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy’s annual rankings. The second biggest donation came from hedge fund manager James Simons and his wife, Marilyn, who gave $500 million to SUNY Stony Brook. Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife, Penny, also made the list with a $400 million pledge to revive a historically Black neighborhood in Portland, Oregon.

**Quote:** “I’m flabbergasted!”

If that was your reaction after opening a Halloween-themed Reese’s treat to find it wasn’t as cute as its packaging suggested, then there’s a class-action lawsuit in Florida for you. The suit alleges that, in order to boost sales, the Hershey-owned brand advertised that its chocolates contained festive designs like smiling jack-o’-lanterns, but in reality, many of the candies were tragically undecorated. The lawsuit quotes scores of unhappy eaters who [took to YouTube](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fK2?mblid=0a91dc8c0d7b&mbcid=33871682.4009717&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to express their shock. Hershey joins Burger King, Taco Bell, and other big food brands in getting sued for alleged false advertising in recent years.

## Darts trivia

Let’s throw it back to darts for today’s trivia question, which will test your intuition rather than knowledge because not many of you will “know” the answer to this.

According to the Darts Regulation Authority, what is the standard height of a dartboard, measured from the floor to the bull’s-eye?  

### ANSWER

5 feet, 8 inches
