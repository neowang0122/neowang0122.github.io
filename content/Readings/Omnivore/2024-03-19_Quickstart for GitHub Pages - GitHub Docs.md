# Full Content: 

You can use GitHub Pages to showcase some open source projects, host a blog, or even share your résumé. This guide will help get you started on creating your next website.

## Who can use this feature?

GitHub Pages is available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[GitHub’s plans](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans)."

## [Introduction](#introduction)

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pages' content and style.

This guide will lead you through creating a user site at `username.github.io`.

## [Creating your website](#creating-your-website)

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, select , then click **New repository**.

2. Enter `username.github.io` as the repository name. Replace `username` with your GitHub username. For example, if your username is `octocat`, the repository name should be `octocat.github.io`.![Screenshot of GitHub Pages settings in a repository. The repository name field contains the text "octocat.github.io" and is outlined in dark orange.](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sQ9nXmxN0MVfCGKbW45NCyixQvA1IwQ56kWMfd0x8CXk/https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-48482/images/help/pages/create-repository-name-pages.png)
3. Under your repository name, click **Settings**. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Settings**.

4. In the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar, click   **Pages**.
5. Under "Build and deployment", under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**.
6. Under "Build and deployment", under "Branch", use the branch dropdown menu and select a publishing source.![Screenshot of Pages settings in a GitHub repository.

7. Optionally, open the `README.md` file of your repository. The `README.md` file is where you will write the content for your site. You can edit the file or keep the default content for now.
8. Visit `username.github.io` to view your new website. Note that it can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub.

## [Changing the title and description](#changing-the-title-and-description)

By default, the title of your site is `username.github.io`. You can change the title by editing the `_config.yml` file in your repository. You can also add a description for your site.

1. Click the **Code** tab of your repository.
2. In the file list, click `_config.yml` to open the file.
3. Click to edit the file.
4. The `_config.yml` file already contains a line that specifies the theme for your site. Add a new line with `title:` followed by the title you want. Add a new line with `description:` followed by the description you want. For example:  
```applescript  
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal  
title: Octocat's homepage  
description: Bookmark this to keep an eye on my project updates!  
```
5. When you are done editing the file, click **Commit changes**.
