**Good morning.** The Women’s World Cup will conclude tomorrow with the finals between England and Spain at 6am ET.

While the USWNT has been out of the tournament for weeks, we Americans can live vicariously through England, which is moving hell and Earth to will their Lionesses to victory. Literally—the Church of England’s lead bishop for sport said that churches can push their Sunday services earlier to accommodate parishioners viewing the game, England’s biggest soccer match since 1966.

But if your Sunday morning vibe is more pub than pew, the UK government is also bending rules to make sure you’re well lubricated for the final, encouraging local councils to let bars open an hour earlier than usual (that’s 11am local time, when the match starts) for pregame festivities.

A series of robots-are-dumb incidents in San Francisco this week has prompted local officials to try to halt the recently approved expansion of self-driving taxis in the city.

General Motors-owned Cruise and Alphabet-owned Waymo have been offering driverless rides in the city for a while now, but service was limited until last week, when the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) granted their request to boost capacity and offer 24/7 commercial rides.

But after a week of Cruise vehicle mishaps that would land them in the Repair Ward if this were the WALL-Everse, the San Francisco City Attorney is asking the CPUC to [press pause](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUn?mblid=a9e525af25e4&mbcid=32447987.116727&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). Since the robotaxi expansion got the green light on August 10…

* Ten driverless Cruise cars [came to a stop](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUo?mblid=43ddfa789064&mbcid=32447987.116727&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) and clogged an intersection near the Outside Lands Music Festival. The company said the vehicles stopped working because concertgoers overwhelmed cell networks, interrupting the cars’ communications.
* Another Cruise car drove through a construction site and, in cartoon gag fashion, got stuck in [wet concrete](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUp?mblid=b149a1ccfd69&mbcid=32447987.116727&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).
* A [person was injured](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUq?mblid=0de5ed564c0f&mbcid=32447987.116727&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) when the autonomous Cruise car they were riding in failed to yield to an oncoming fire truck, which was responding to an emergency.

[Waymo](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUr?mblid=4ba5689d0f27&mbcid=32447987.116727&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) has had its fair share of incidents, too: Cars blocked a firehouse in May, struck and killed a dog the same month, and stopped in front of a public bus in March. But since last summer, autonomous car accidents have reportedly become rarer, likely because the vehicles learn how to react to certain situations as they encounter them.

**The cab hail of the future:** Even if the CPUC agrees to postpone the recent expansion, it would likely just be a road bump. App downloads for Cruise and Waymo surged this week, and the companies are gearing up to roll out fleets in Los Angeles, New York, Austin, and Miami._—ML_

* The usual 36 ships-per-day limit was slashed to 32 last month to save water, creating a backlog of idling vessels.

## Your shopping budget might get dried out, too

The canal carries a third of the maritime trade between the Americas and Asia, per the Wall Street Journal. Delays and a rule limiting some ships’ weight are already pushing up cargo costs, right as many companies ramp up delivery orders in preparation for this year’s holiday season. And those costs could get passed along, steepening your gift-giving bill.

We thought we were the only ones enjoying the sounds of thunder while we wrote this newsletter. But it turns out white noise podcasts are so popular that Spotify considered [nixing them](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUF?mblid=5fbc38a4375b&mbcid=32447987.116727&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) from the platform to bring in an extra $38 million a year, according to an internal memo Bloomberg viewed.

Spotify’s document said that as of January 2023, white noise and ambient podcasts (think rainforest mixes, static, or even lawn mower sounds) made up “3 million daily consumption hours on the platform.”

But Spotify wasn’t making much money off these sounds, even as calming noise makers were raking in \~$18,000/month from the platform’s ads. All while Spotify’s algorithms were sending listeners their way thanks to an effort to push users to the talk-based programs (versus music) that Spotify was investing in heavily to boost subscriptions. 

**Ethereal box fans can rest easy (for now).** While Spotify did consider a plan to thwart bird sound-looping freeloaders by removing white noise and banning future uploads, it didn’t end up going through with the plan to leave you with nothing to fall asleep to but Joe Rogan. Still, some static makers have complained in Reddit threads recently that their content occasionally disappears from the platform._—MM_

**Stat:** While Beyoncé might be responsible for inflation in Sweden, neighboring Denmark has a different superstar impacting its economy: Novo Nordisk. The company, which makes Ozempic and Wegovy, has grown so much this year that its $419 billion [market value](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUJ?mblid=f56d24b92719&mbcid=32447987.116727&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) eclipsed the nation’s $406 billion GDP, the Wall Street Journal reports. And it’s affecting Danish currency. Per the WSJ, the weight-loss drugs’ strong US sales meant the company was converting unusually large amounts of dollars into kroner, raising the local currency’s value relative to the euro and spurring the central bank to lower interest rates to keep the exchange rate steady.

## Open House

Welcome to Open House, the only newsletter section that is genuinely worried about all the vases it might knock over. We’ll give you a few facts about a listing and you try to guess the price.

![Mansion in Maimi, Florida. Huge garden with manicured hedges and palm trees. The home is full of dark wood and decorative vases.](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sMjbUVqNV5iHeICVEtVLhDE-BbjK7fJnWLWs007pCI7c/https://storage.morningbrew.com/gif/2023-08-18/image-b90c45d6d349ebf692f2a5d855a22203bed39e31-1060x651-gif/miami.gif)_Zillow_

Today’s [listing](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aUW?mblid=2e60aaf34d85&mbcid=32447987.116727&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) is in Miami, Florida, and was built in 1924\. The home, named “Le Jardin,” has so much perfectly manicured greenery you’d think Frances Hodgson Burnett designed it herself. Amenities include:

* 6 beds, 6 baths
* Spanish barrel tile roof
* Human-sized checkerboard yard

How much for this classically overdressed home?
