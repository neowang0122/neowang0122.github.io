**Good morning.** Last Sunday, they watched everyone else smooch as the clock struck midnight, and this Sunday, they’re out for revenge. Tomorrow, the first Sunday of the year, is typically the most popular day for singles to use dating apps. Tinder says the number of messages sent on “Dating Sunday” runs 22% higher than normal levels, the number of likes increases 18.2%, and the average response time is 19.4 minutes faster than on a typical Sunday.

To avoid being overwhelmed, keep an eye out for other Morning Brew readers. If you both like the same newsletter, then you’ll probably share similar values of emotional availability and mutual trust.

Canada already supplies the US with hockey stars and imaginary girlfriends, and it might soon add its famously cheaper prescription drugs to the list. Yesterday, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [approved Florida’s request](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fTh?mblid=1fd31a440234&mbcid=33911319.3526187&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to import bargain meds from the country.

It’s the first state to get permission from the agency to bring in meds from Canada under a law Congress passed 20 years ago to help Americans pay less for drugs. Florida officials say ordering cheaper drugs for conditions like HIV and diabetes from Canadian wholesalers will save Medicaid and other state programs $150 million over the first year.

## Will this go mainstream?

The FDA’s go-ahead to Florida establishes an understanding that foreign suppliers can safely fill Americans’ pill bottles and paves the way for other states to get similar approvals.

* Eight states besides Florida have laws that will allow them to import drugs if the FDA OKs it. And some, like Colorado, have already applied for approval, per the New York Times.
* To get signoff, a state has to prove that importing the medications would actually lower consumer prices and that the drugs adhere to the FDA’s safety standards.

But it’s not a done deal: Pharma lobbyists will likely challenge the FDA’s Florida decision in court, and some producers already bar Canadian companies from selling their products across the border.

## There’s no magic pill

Experts say the high drug costs in the US are ultimately driven by the patent protections that allow pharma companies to maintain a prolonged monopoly on drug production. The Inflation Reduction Act, which enables the government to haggle with pharmaceutical manufacturers over prices for some drugs, does much more to lower costs than imports will, University of Michigan Law School expert Nicholas Bagley told the New York Times. He called Florida’s plan “political theater.”

Other commentators point out that Canada’s pharma market is too small to meet all Americans’ needs. The country is already making moves to restrict exports of drugs that are scarce.

**Cheap drugs aren’t always a good thing…**industry experts told Axios that lower drug prices sometimes [reduce the incentive](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fTi?mblid=33587ed74f9f&mbcid=33911319.3526187&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for manufacturers to produce them, creating shortages._—SK_

Trump’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued in their own filing that James has not proven her case and there should be no penalty.

* To try and pay off some debt (and keep the company out of bankruptcy), AMC completed a 10:1 reverse stock split in August, consolidating every ten shares that investors already had into one, and converted its “APE” preferred shares into regular old AMC stock.

The NFL regular season wraps up tomorrow, and at least one team is very much looking forward to it being over: the last-place Carolina Panthers. They’re about to log their sixth straight losing season under billionaire owner David Tepper—and Panthers fans may hate him even more than they hate themselves.

Thousands of people have signed a [petition](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fTy?mblid=dfaa8c050352&mbcid=33911319.3526187&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) calling for the hedge fund manager to sell the Panthers. It was created after Tepper [threw a drink](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fTz?mblid=87503619b36f&mbcid=33911319.3526187&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) at a Jaguars fan last Sunday, earning him a $300,000 league fine, which accounts for less than 1% of 1% of his \~$21 billion net worth, according to [ESPN](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fTA?mblid=c9037effc351&mbcid=33911319.3526187&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

**He’s not used to losing.** Tepper’s hedge fund, Appaloosa Management, made $2 billion by snatching up tech stocks including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Uber last year, according to [Bloomberg](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fTB?mblid=768988fde673&mbcid=33911319.3526187&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). And though the Panthers have stunk it up on the field, they’ve thrived as a financial asset: Sportico [estimates](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fTC?mblid=9306e85954c6&mbcid=33911319.3526187&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the franchise is worth nearly twice as much now as when Tepper bought it for $2.3 billion in 2018.

**Stat:** You’ll have to find somewhere besides the Great Lakes to perfect your double salchow. Warm weather this winter has led to the [least ice cover](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fTJ?mblid=ea18cdb03fe1&mbcid=33911319.3526187&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the North American Great Lakes have seen in 50 years. At this point in the year, the lakes are on average 10.6% covered with ice, but as of Thursday, it was just 0.43%, per the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. The decline in ice on the freshwater lakes is being watched closely for its connection to climate change, especially since it could trigger extreme weather nearby, according to the Financial Times.

**Quote:** “Much of the clip is somewhat amusing.”

An arbitrator recently ordered Philadelphia-based NPR affiliate WHYY [to rehire](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fTK?mblid=1656afeb7b4f&mbcid=33911319.3526187&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) reporter Jad Sleiman, who was fired for sharing clips of his stand-up comedy online, ruling that he hadn’t violated WHYY’s policy against inflammatory social media posts because…the jokes were funny. Analyzing the stand-up bits, the arbitrator found that while some could potentially be offensive, many were clever critiques, and one was “simply funny.” WHYY told news outlets it was reviewing the decision and its next steps, but Sleiman has already decided on his, saying, “I’m going to walk in there like f\*\*king Vince McMahon.”
