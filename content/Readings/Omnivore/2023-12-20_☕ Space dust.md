**Good morning.** The State Department announced that passport processing times have returned to pre-Covid levels, and it casually slipped in a jaw-dropping stat: In 1990, only 5% of Americans had a passport. Today, 48% do (though only 5% actually know where they’ve put it). The more than 160 million US passports in circulation today are almost double the number from 2007.

That’s good news for global camaraderie. A recent Pew [survey](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ftv?mblid=442e24aed473&mbcid=33752391.4043430&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) found that Americans who have traveled internationally are more interested in and more knowledgeable about foreign affairs, and they feel closer to others around the world.

Jeff Bezos has liftoff!…finally. Blue Origin [launched](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fuc?mblid=dc55c19defb5&mbcid=33752391.4043430&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) a spacecraft yesterday for the first time since September 2022, when a tech failure turned that mission into a space snafu. On Tuesday, the uncrewed New Shepard rocket took 33 [research payloads](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fud?mblid=157b30aba1ed&mbcid=33752391.4043430&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) and 38,000 postcards from Blue Origin’s youth STEM club on a space excursion.

Despite the win, the Jeff Bezos-owned startup that was once William Shatner’s extraterrestrial taxi now looks like the Carolina Panthers of the corporate space race. With almost 100 successful launches this year and fat government contracts, Musk’s SpaceX is so far ahead that Blue Origin might need a telescope to spot it.

## Cosmic catch-up

To be fair, Bezos is not starry-eyed about his passion business. He [recently told](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fms?mblid=732a8235b114&mbcid=33752391.4043430&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) podcaster Lex Fridman that Blue Origin needs to get it together. Bezos plans to kick it into high gear by making it, in his words, “the world’s most decisive company.”

* The Amazon founder believes that many of its technology choices can be made with less deliberation by “small teams deep in the company.”
* Bezos also shared that he ditched his Amazon CEO role specifically to focus on ~~cosplaying as a cowboy~~ ramping up progress at Blue Origin.

Meanwhile, Amazon is trying to challenge Musk’s satellite business, Starlink, with its Project Kuiper subsidiary. But here, Team Bezos’s straggler status is even more apparent: Project Kuiper launched its first two test satellites this fall, while Starlink already has 5,000 delivering internet to 2 million customers.

**Blue Origin is still optimistic…**about debuting its next-generation rocket, New Glenn, sometime next year, which NASA will use to launch an exploration robot to Mars. Blue Origin also recently notched a deal to build a human moon landing system for the space agency after losing out to SpaceX on a similar contract two years ago._—SK_

Rhysida, a ransomware group that previously attacked the British Library, released over 1.3 million files pertaining to Sony’s game developer Insomniac Games yesterday.

The [cache](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fui?mblid=e52deaf408e2&mbcid=33752391.4043430&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) reportedly included internal presentations, Slack screenshots, and employees' personal information, which were leaked after the company failed to pay the $2 million demanded by Rhysida. If what’s in the unverified 1.67 terabytes of stolen data is true, we’ve learned some details about new games:

* Sony Interactive has an agreement with Marvel for a [trilogy](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fuj?mblid=d16f675a7c9d&mbcid=33752391.4043430&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of _X-Men_ games, according to Cyber Daily. Alleged footage from the first game, _Wolverine_, was released in the hack and is already [flooding](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fuk?mblid=435d54153ac5&mbcid=33752391.4043430&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the internet.
* The files included a discussion of a _Spider-Man 3_ game, a game based on _Venom_, and a new _Ratchet & Clank_, according to The Verge.

**As for what was happening inside Sony…**internal documents released in the hack show that executives were concerned about Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard after the deal [closed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/d1T?mblid=d02e803ad8df&mbcid=33752391.4043430&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in October.

In one slide, Sony said it was worried that the acquisition could “disrupt and threaten” the console and game subscription markets in 2027\. Sony’s PlayStation currently dominates the console industry, but these internal discussions highlight how Sony thinks that could all change once Microsoft gains control of Activision’s insanely popular _Call of Duty_ franchise—which is only guaranteed to remain on PlayStation through 2027\. Sony declined Morning Brew’s request for comment on the hack._—CC_

A viral TikTok trend is making wearable tech kinda cool. Videos of popular users wearing the new Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (usually while lip-syncing K-pop songs) are [amassing](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fu2?mblid=9ef493fab094&mbcid=33752391.4043430&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) millions of views. That’s a step in the right direction for Meta’s metaverse, which—like the Nebraska Volleyball fan in your life—is down pretty bad right now.

**What’s so special about the Meta glasses?** The $300 tech looks almost identical to a normal pair of Ray-Bans—aside from the small cameras in the upper corners of the frames that flash when taking a high-quality photo or pulse when recording. The glasses also respond to voice commands to text or call someone. But Meta is banking on them to do much more in the future. The company [announced](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fu3?mblid=3cef61e7e030&mbcid=33752391.4043430&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) last week that the specs will soon be able to use Meta AI to translate languages in real time for wearers, come up with funny photo captions, and help pick out clothes. 

**Big picture:** If they work as intended, these features could finally push wearable AR and VR technology into the mainstream after years of failed attempts (remember Google Glass?). But if the TikTok trend is just a brief fad and the eyewear doesn’t take off, Meta’s risky multibillion-dollar pivot to the metaverse will be that much closer to failure. VR headset and AR glasses sales in the US have already [dropped](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fu4?mblid=7acc53d69cb8&mbcid=33752391.4043430&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) 40% in the last year, according to Circana data reviewed by CNBC.—_MM_

![A scene from A Christmas Story](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,sjcD-U8XQtbKTMuoqo2cnMiYaVeacR_IFhQ6fxhib4pA/https://storage.morningbrew.com/gif/2023-12-19/image-4c0c3ff3bdb51fa76878e53240ba35938e5a4752-1500x1000-gif/MBD_Editorial_artificialchristmas_AF_121923(1).gif) _A Christmas Story/Warner Bros._ 

**Stat:** Pour some eggnog out for natural Christmas trees. According to a [survey](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ftb?mblid=50812fccb68f&mbcid=33752391.4043430&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) from the American Christmas Tree Association, 77% of Americans who display a tree this year will choose an artificial one. That coincides with a boom for artificial trees: In 2023, the US will import nearly 450 million fake trees (most of them from China), up from 190 million a decade ago. Consumers tend to prefer their consistent appearance and cost savings over time, per the survey. Meanwhile, there are fewer and fewer real Christmas trees to go around following the 2008 financial crisis, when many farmers pivoted to planting crops that don’t take seven years to grow.

**Quote:** “It absolutely scared the you-know-what out of me. It’s New York City. It’s the last thing you expect to see.”

If you can’t see Flaco the owl, that doesn’t mean he can’t see you. NYC resident Reilly Richardson found that out the hard way when she discovered the Eurasian eagle-owl—who escaped from the Central Park Zoo in February—outside her window, [watching her closely](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ftc?mblid=5d291ff304af&mbcid=33752391.4043430&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). And that wasn’t a one-off: With his newfound freedom, Flaco has apparently taken to acting like Jimmy Stewart in _Rear Window_, peeping on unsuspecting neighbors as he reconnoiters Manhattan. One owl expert told the WSJ that it’s possible Flaco sees humans as potential mates.
