ITHACA, N.Y. — The City of Ithaca’s annual street cleaning will start April 1 in Collegetown and continue around the rest of the city, signaling the start of Spring and heightened chances of car-towing.   
纽约州伊萨卡——伊萨卡市一年一度的街道清洁工作将于 4 月 1 日在大学城开始，并在城市其他地方继续进行，这标志着春天的开始，也标志着汽车拖车机会的增加。

The entire city’s streets will be cleaned gradually starting next week. The full schedule of cleaning can be found below.   
从下周开始，全市街道将逐步进行清洁。完整的清洁时间表如下。

The Department of Public Works encouraged residents to rake the area between the sidewalk and the curb at their properties, placing the raked materials in the street gutter before the street cleaners come through their neighborhood.   
公共工程部鼓励居民清扫自家住宅的人行道和路边之间的区域，并在街道清洁工进入他们的社区之前将清扫的材料放入街道排水沟中。

“Any material raked into the gutter after street cleaning is performed will be removed at the property owner’s expense,” reads the announcement from the city.   
该市的公告称：“街道清洁后，任何被耙入排水沟的材料都将被清除，费用由业主承担。”

Since the street cleaning will start in Collegetown during Cornell’s spring break, the city’s announcement states that people leaving for vacation should not leave vehicles parked on the street, as they will be ticketed and towed.   
由于康奈尔大学春假期间将开始大学城的街道清洁工作，该市的公告指出，外出度假的人们不应将车辆停在街上，因为它们将被开罚单并被拖走。

“No parking” signs will be posted on each street 24 hours before the street is slated to be cleaned, which means cars must be moved from street parking by 7 a.m. on the date of cleaning.   
在街道预定清洁前 24 小时，每条街道上都会张贴“禁止停车”标志，这意味着汽车必须在清洁当日早上 7 点之前从路边停车场移走。

The city’s announcement included that the base fee for a towed car is $200 and storage costs $50 per day after the first 24 hours.   
该市的公告包括，拖车的基本费用为 200 美元，24 小时后每天的存储费用为 50 美元。

The [Tompkins SIREN system](https://www.cityofithaca.org/617/Emergency-Notifications) will be used to alert residents who are subscribed to the street cleaning notification list. Updates will also be posted to Facebook and Twitter.   
汤普金斯 SIREN 系统将用于提醒订阅街道清洁通知列表的居民。更新也将发布到 Facebook 和 Twitter。

Those in need of long-term parking to replace their street parking spot should call the City Chamberlain’s Office for opportunities.   
那些需要长期停车来更换路边停车位的人应该致电市张伯伦办公室寻求机会。
