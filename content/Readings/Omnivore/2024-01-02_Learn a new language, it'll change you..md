### And it's really fun!

Happy new year! 

I'm not big on New Year's ==resolutions.  If I really want to do something,  it seems pointless to wait for the turn of the year to do it.== 

In September, I set out to re-learn French. I've been meaning to get back to learning it for 7 years now, since I graduated from college. 

But **how** should I learn it?

Going to a physical language school was not an option, I don't have the time for it, and to stay consistent I needed it to be as frictionless as possible.

Language apps weren't an option either. They're good. I actually use Duolingo every day when I have nothing better to do. But let's be real, it's a supplement, not a replacement for a real class. 

Eventually, I landed on iTalki. It's like Upwork, but for language tutors. After a couple of trials, I found a tutor that I liked, and I've been having 2 classes a week with her.

It's really affordable because these aren't formal teachers, they're community tutors, usually students or professionals that do this part-time. So it's kinda like chatting with a friend that corrects you. 

Unlike formal teachers, I’ve found community tutors much more pleasant to work with. There are no rules. Most of them will just adapt to you. 

All I do with my tutor is talk. It honestly feels like therapy because the whole point is to get me talking, so they have to ask me questions. We also have interesting discussions on random topics and overall just have fun. I prefer to not have homework, so there’s none of that either.

^ This graph is just based on experience with zero evidence to back it up other than what I went through with other languages.

  
The hardest part of language learning is getting to B1\. After that, growth becomes exponential because you can simply talk and get corrected. It stalls again at C1, but by that point, you can have any conversation with anyone, so it's not like you're painstakingly learning the basics just to get around.

I’m 21 lessons in, and it’s become a part of my routine at this point and something I look forward to.

If you decide to give iTalki a go, you can use my [link](https://substack.com/redirect/4fd09817-ab55-467a-beb7-517a56e833ab?j=eyJ1IjoiMnkycXRhIn0.nuzIT9a4BeQSNYg8gdQVbZ5ZSwrFjuJ7f2hzSpwFB-Y) for $5 off. This isn't sponsored or anything, just a stellar platform that I really enjoy.

## Monthly Picks

_A handful of new finds that I think are worth sharing._ 

**Art** \- Grid Studio - This was a favorite in the last video, which I didn’t expect. I didn't even bother mentioning it in the video, but I do have a 10% off your first order with my [link](https://substack.com/redirect/52f6cb55-c5b8-44cd-8a2f-77c4419a9e42?j=eyJ1IjoiMnkycXRhIn0.nuzIT9a4BeQSNYg8gdQVbZ5ZSwrFjuJ7f2hzSpwFB-Y).

**Comedy -** Armageddon by Ricky Gervais - Not as good as his other special, Humanity, but I enjoyed it.

**Video -[ ](https://substack.com/redirect/53017ad5-edf2-4c4d-9daf-c24067d81311?j=eyJ1IjoiMnkycXRhIn0.nuzIT9a4BeQSNYg8gdQVbZ5ZSwrFjuJ7f2hzSpwFB-Y)**[Why coke at Mcdonald's tastes different](https://substack.com/redirect/53017ad5-edf2-4c4d-9daf-c24067d81311?j=eyJ1IjoiMnkycXRhIn0.nuzIT9a4BeQSNYg8gdQVbZ5ZSwrFjuJ7f2hzSpwFB-Y) \- Self explanatory title, interesting watch!

**Movie -** The Man from Earth - Rewatched this masterpiece over the holidays. Proof that a successful movie doesn’t need a high budget. It’s a polarizing movie, you either love it or hate it. 

That's all I found worthy of sharing.

Thanks for reading, and happy new year! :)
