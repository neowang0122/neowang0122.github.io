As some of you know, I attended the COP28 conference this year in Dubai. I watched and participated in the conference for its entire duration and was thrilled by it. My primary focus was on the ocean because that's the part I'm passionate about, but I was excited and concerned by much more. Iâ€™ve summarized some brief takeaways in an article that you can read using the link below, and I will follow with more complete thoughts about the climate issue, which I believe is one of the five big forces changing the world order. 

 If you have any feedback or your own perspective on COP28, you can share those with me directly on [Facebook](https://principles.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f817138263fa3d3dec4ad231d&id=01c09ba48b&e=bc6bf78208), [Instagram](https://principles.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f817138263fa3d3dec4ad231d&id=35d6e405c1&e=bc6bf78208), [LinkedIn](https://principles.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f817138263fa3d3dec4ad231d&id=2b461586ca&e=bc6bf78208), and [Twitter/X](https://principles.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f817138263fa3d3dec4ad231d&id=85b0c362bf&e=bc6bf78208).
