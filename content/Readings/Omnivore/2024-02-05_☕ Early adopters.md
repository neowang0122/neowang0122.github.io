**Good morning.** They didn’t mention it at the Grammys, but a major music milestone will be hit today. For the first time in two years, another note will be played in what is undoubtedly the [longest concert in history](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gUJ?mblid=44d3180ac0c7&mbcid=34233302.3947614&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

You see, musicians at a medieval church in Germany are performing a piece by the legendary avant-garde composer John Cage, and they’re taking Cage’s instruction to play it As Slow As Possible quite literally. The concert began in 2001 and is not scheduled to finish for another 616 years. A D note will be played on the organ today; the next note will be an A in August 2026, and the final one won’t be struck until at least 2640.

And on that note, have a wonderful day.

Taylor Swift now [stands alone in music history](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gVe?mblid=03879fe27dbb&mbcid=34233302.3947614&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) after winning her fourth Grammy for album of the year for _Midnights_ last night, breaking a tie with Frank Sinatra, Paul Simon, and Stevie Wonder for the most all-time. She also reminded us of the work ethic that made her a billionaire—using an acceptance speech to announce a new album, _The Tortured Poets Department_, out in April.

Even beyond Swift, the Grammys were dominated by women artists. Miley Cyrus won her first Grammy for “Flowers,” Billie Eilish took home song of the year for “What Was I Made For?” and singer-songwriter Victoria Monét was awarded best new artist. SZA and Boygenius also had big nights.

## The performances

Every meeting this morning will likely be delayed by 10 minutes with a discussion about the two goosebump-inducing performances by Joni Mitchell and Tracy Chapman.

* Mitchell—who won for best folk album—performed at the Grammys for the first time at the age of 80\. It marked the latest step in a remarkable recovery after she suffered a brain aneurysm in 2015.
* The reclusive Chapman performed a duet of “Fast Car” with Luke Combs, whose cover of her 1988 Grammy-winning song has brought her newfound acclaim from a new generation.

## The music industry has a “hangover”

The juggernaut that is Taylor Swift—her [sales](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gVf?mblid=ae523c9e7b66&mbcid=34233302.3947614&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) accounted for 2% of the entire US music business last year, which was more than the entire jazz and classical genres brought in—is the anomaly, not the trend. Following a wave of layoffs over the past year at companies like Spotify, one executive told the Financial Times that the industry is enduring a “hangover.”

**AI and social media also threaten major disruption.** The music of Universal Music Group’s artists—including big names like Drake, Lana Del Rey, and Ariana Grande—was [removed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gNq?mblid=4abcc2a72c1d&mbcid=34233302.3947614&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) from TikTok last week after the two parties failed to negotiate a new licensing deal. Universal bashed TikTok for allowing AI-generated music to spread, while TikTok countered that it provides unrivaled promotion of Universal’s artists to an audience of more than 1 billion users. Until one side blinks, TikTok users won’t be able to soundtrack their videos with Universal musicians, some of whom won Grammys on Sunday.

Downtown Los Angeles is expected to receive over six inches of rain through Tuesday, which is nearly half its average annual rainfall.

As of Monday morning, more than 900,000 residents had lost power, with the number expected to increase as rain and winds continue.

The Biden administration has stepped up direct military involvement in the Middle East in response to a drone attack that killed three American soldiers in Jordan last week and ongoing attacks by the Houthis against commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The US, UK, and other allies said their goal is to “de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea” through these acts of deterrence, but the Houthis do not appear to be deterred and have pledged to retaliate. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the strikes were just “the beginning” of its response.

Saturday marked one year since a Norfolk Southern freight train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, spilling \~1 million gallons of toxic chemicals into local waterways, forcing residents to temporarily evacuate, and causing millions of dollars in economic losses.

The accident was supposed to serve as a wake-up call around rail safety, but a year later, not much has changed in regulating the industry. Congress has not passed a rail safety bill, and derailments by the biggest US railroads [increased 13%](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gUO?mblid=a36a85c75674&mbcid=34233302.3947614&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)in the first 10 months of 2023.

**What about the Railway Safety Act?** The month after the Norfolk Southern crash, a bipartisan Senate duo unveiled the Railway Safety Act to increase industry oversight and prevent other chemical spills. And although Norfolk Southern and its Big Rail competitors have said they’d cooperate with Congress on the bill, behind the scenes, they’ve been attempting to [derail its core provisions](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gUP?mblid=cfc60fd3ebdc&mbcid=34233302.3947614&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) through the industry’s powerful lobbying arm, the Washington Post reported.

In the absence of more regulation, Norfolk Southern said it made several changes on its own to reduce the likelihood of accidents.

**Meanwhile, back in East Palestine…**the mayor said “roughly 90 to 95% of \[the damage\] is cleaned up,” though some residents [remain wary](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gUQ?mblid=b7db48136741&mbcid=34233302.3947614&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of the long-term health impacts.—_NF_

**SCOTUS to decide if Trump can appear on 2024 ballots:** The Supreme Court—which includes three justices appointed by Trump—will listen to arguments on Thursday over whether the former president can be excluded from ballots due to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Trump is appealing a Colorado ruling that found he violated a clause in the 14th Amendment, which says an elected official cannot return to office after engaging in an insurrection. The court’s decision will effectively decide if Trump’s pursuit to reclaim the White House can continue, as 11 other states are challenging his eligibility.

**Border bill vote:** The Senate is expected to vote on a [long-awaited bill](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gUW?mblid=bbcc2c2a688c&mbcid=34233302.3947614&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), which was released yesterday, intended to dramatically reduce illegal crossings at the US–Mexico border by establishing a new asylum process. The bill would also send $118 billion in funds to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, humanitarian efforts, and the Southern border, with Ukraine receiving more than half ($60 billion) of the allocation. But the bill faces opposition from members of both parties, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said it was DOA if it made it to his chamber.

**Another big earnings week:** Whether you’re into cheeseburgers (McDonald’s), spending money to cut lines (Disney), hauling stuff in trucks (Ford), paying extra for guac (Chipotle), or paying extra for medicine (Eli Lilly), there’s an earnings report for you this week. A strong earnings season so far has helped push the major stock indexes to four straight weekly gains.
