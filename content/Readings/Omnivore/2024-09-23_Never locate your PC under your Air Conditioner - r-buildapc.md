 TL;DR: AC Condensation ALMOST killed my RTX 2070 super  
TL;DR：交流冷凝差点毁了我的 RTX 2070 super

 So basically i was peacefully watching netflix on my PC then suddenly screen goes black and i immediately jump to 200 pm heartbeat. I first thought monitor just has an oopsie but then i go on inspect my little boy and notice its wet on top of the case. Since it has fans on top its basically open which triggers my panic mode and i unplug the whole thing.  
所以基本上我在电脑上平静地观看 Netflix，然后突然屏幕变黑，我的心跳立即跳到下午 200 点。我首先以为监视器只是有一个 oopsie，但后来我继续检查我的小男孩，发现它的盒子顶部湿了。因为它上面有风扇，所以它基本上是打开的，这触发了我的恐慌模式，我拔掉了整个东西。

 Its my first DIY build. No warranties, no RMA so if something bad happens to it i would have to swallow it. I dissasemble it to detect where on earth was the water landing to cause the sudden screen blackout but to my surprise... i CANT find the damn water! All is dry inside, nothing has traces of liquid or looks wet. I turn it on again but nothing, screen wont receive signal.  
这是我的第一个 DIY 作品。没有保修，没有 RMA，所以如果出现问题，我将不得不吞下它。我拆开它来检测水到底落在哪里，导致屏幕突然黑屏，但令我惊讶的是……我找不到该死的水！内部一切都是干燥的，没有任何液体痕迹或看起来潮湿。我再次打开它，但没有任何反应，屏幕收不到信号。

 At this point i was starting to lose my sanity, then i see it... something reflecting under the GPU backplate. My blood froze and i realize i might have lost my couldnt-resist-lost-to-scalper-pandemic-buyers-remorse baby. So i decided to dissasemble it. I had never opened a GPU before and i didnt even have the thermal pads to replace (i cant find any on my country). But since not opening meant accepting it was gone i just went yolo and did it. It was wet, all over the backplate there was a huge splash of liquid. I left it to dry overnight and the day after it still wouldnt send displayport signal. Then i decided to check if hdmi would work and to my surprise IT DID. I never felt so relieved, i switch to hdmi and just give up on the idea of having more monitors since all 3 displayports wouldnt work.  
此时我开始失去理智，然后我看到了……有东西在 GPU 背板下反射。我的血液凝固了，我意识到我可能已经失去了我无法抗拒的失去了黄牛大流行买家悔恨的宝贝。所以我决定拆解它。我以前从未打开过 GPU，甚至没有可以更换的导热垫（我在我的国家找不到任何导热垫）。但由于不打开意味着接受它已经消失了，我就去了 yolo 并做到了。湿漉漉的，背板上溅满了大片液体。我让它干燥过夜，第二天它仍然不会发送显示端口信号。然后我决定检查 hdmi 是否可以工作，令我惊讶的是它确实可以工作。我从未感到如此轻松，我切换到 HDMI，并放弃了拥有更多显示器的想法，因为所有 3 个显示端口都无法工作。

 The next day however i tried again and... the displayport started working again! Happy ending  
然而第二天，我再次尝试......显示端口再次开始工作！幸福的结局

 Im making this post to ensure nobody has to live the same experience. Please, ==DO NOT PLACE YOUR PC UNDER THE AIR CONDITIONER.== If your contry has a humid climate that might be its demise.  
我发表这篇文章是为了确保没有人有同样的经历。请不要将您的电脑放置在空调下方。如果你的国家气候潮湿，那可能就是它的灭亡。

 Also dont give up on wet electronics, sometimes it just takes a careful drying and some patience (and a ton of luck) to save an otherwise lost device.  
也不要放弃潮湿的电子产品，有时只需要仔细干燥和一些耐心（以及大量的运气）即可挽救丢失的设备。
