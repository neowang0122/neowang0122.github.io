**Good morning.** History will be made in Kansas City today, when the KC Current play the Portland Thorns in a National Women’s Soccer League match. They’ll inaugurate the new $120 million CPKC Stadium—which, according to its owners, is the _only_ stadium in the world built solely for a women’s pro sports team. Those owners, by the way, include Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes and his wife, former soccer pro Brittany Mahomes.

CPKC Stadium seats 11,500 people, but with season tickets sold out for months, it may be a question of when, not if, it gets expanded.

### REAL ESTATE

Not since the 1990s “man cave” boom has the real estate market been shaken so irremediably. Yesterday, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) [agreed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iqr?mblid=e1e856011739&mbcid=34705765.3416760&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to pay $418 million over the next four years to settle several lawsuits alleging it artificially inflated realtor commissions. Included in the deal is a policy change that will likely obliterate agents’ 5%–6% commissions.

**For decades…**selling your house meant agreeing to pay that fee—the highest in the world compared to most countries’ 1% to 3%—if you wanted your home on almost any listing service. The fee was split between your agent and the buyer’s agent.

The lawsuits argued that the NAR and brokerages kept buyers and sellers out of the commission negotiation process, leading to higher overall housing costs. Under the settlement, the NAR would no longer require that brokers advertising homes for sale compensate the buyer’s agent, likely forcing agents to lower fees to stay competitive, a change that’s ultimately likely to lower home costs.

## What happens next?

If a federal court approves the deal, the NAR would see a lot of legal drama go away—including a $1.8 billion [jury verdict](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dRp?mblid=596ae0a174df&mbcid=34705765.3416760&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) from a case in Missouri and other similar cases that could have pushed it toward bankruptcy, an outcome the deal should prevent.

The head of the NAR told news outlets the settlement “benefits our members and American consumers.” But the settlement also highlights the once-powerful association’s waning influence in the real estate industry.

* Getting rid of the commission-sharing structure likely means a 30% drop in the $100 billion Americans pay every year in commission fees, according to investment banking firm KBW.
* It also opens the door to home-buying startups that couldn’t operate under previous regulations (think Carvana for a 3-bedroom).

Some real estate agents will see a sharp cut in their paychecks while others, at least a million, will leave the industry, according to KBW.

**Bottom line:** The settlement represents a sea change for what it costs to buy and sell homes in the US, and some experts believe it could give the housing market a major boost._—MM_

It’s not the only place gig economy players are fighting against higher wages for drivers: Uber is among the delivery services suing New York City over its new wage requirements for delivery workers.

The Vermont senator who loves democratic socialism and mittens introduced new legislation this week that would make all your weekends three days long _without_ reducing your [paycheck](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iqA?mblid=2f738233953b&mbcid=34705765.3416760&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), citing the time-saving powers of AI.

The Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act brought forward by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Laphonza Butler would:

* Lower the federally recognized standard workweek and overtime threshold from 40 hours to 32 hours over four years, while ensuring employers don’t cut full-time worker pay by eight hours’ worth of wages.
* Require 1.5x overtime when workdays are longer than eight hours and 2x pay when they surpass 12 hours.

Sanders presented growing evidence that the four-day workweek can lead to less burnout and more productivity.

**Don’t get your hopes up.** This is at least the third attempt in three years to enshrine the four-day workweek in federal law, and since the idea still doesn’t have bipartisan support, the bill will probably stall out. Republicans have voiced concerns that the proposal could hurt retail and small businesses—and one Louisiana senator even likened it to “napalm upon the fire of inflation.”

Americans need more professionals to desperately dial when their pipe problems can’t be solved with a plunger. Bloomberg highlighted this week how a [plumber shortage](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iqH?mblid=1037c45090a3&mbcid=34705765.3416760&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) means more than just increased wait times for a working toilet.

The lack of licensed tradespeople who install and fix bathroom fixtures and piping systems drained $33 billion from the economy in 2022, according to an analysis sponsored by bathroom-fittings maker Lixil. The report says the US will be short 550,000 plumbers by 2027, which is bad news for just about everyone except plumbers.

* Plumber shortages can drive up costs for families and hamper businesses’ ability to expand to new buildings.
* They can also [delay](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iqI?mblid=709153cebc6a&mbcid=34705765.3416760&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) flood recovery efforts and building upgrades to make water systems more efficient.
* Plumbing pros also play a vital role in the industrial boom that recent government infrastructure spending has spurred.

**Where’d all the plumbers go?** Many of them are retiring, and employers are struggling to recruit a new generation of trained professionals, given the well-paid but not-so-glamorous vocation’s reputation for involving dirty and physically strenuous work, according to Bloomberg.

**Zoom out:** The US also needs more carpenters, electricians, and other technical tradespeople.

**Stat:** While everyone’s been watching Washington, concerned about the fate of TikTok, there’s another popular video-sharing spot that’s disappearing from certain states: Pornhub. The site [pulled out](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iqN?mblid=2cd04091282e&mbcid=34705765.3416760&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of Texas this week after an appeals court upheld the state’s requirement that porn sites verify user ages. Never ones to accept being messed with, Texans sought a solution: Google searches for VPNs quadrupled in the state in the hours following Pornhub’s announcement, per CNN. The site has ditched a handful of other states over similar laws and, according to The Electronic Frontier Foundation, VPN searches have also spiked elsewhere in response.

**Quote:** “His life in recent years has been one of unmatched greed and hubris; of ambition and rationalization; and courting risk and gambling repeatedly with other people’s money.”

Prosecutors did not mince words yesterday in trying to convince a judge to give former FTX CEO and Bermuda shorts devotee Sam Bankman-Fried a [lengthy sentence](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iqO?mblid=ac68a796551b&mbcid=34705765.3416760&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). They argued SBF deserves to be behind bars for 40–50 years and should be forced to pay $11+ billion. Lawyers for the erstwhile crypto entrepreneur, who plans to appeal his fraud conviction, have suggested that just five or six years would suffice. Sentencing is scheduled for March 28.
