The Maui town of Lāhainā will never be the same. This week, unprecedented wildfires ripped through the historic area where the Hawaiian Kingdom’s constitution was drafted, destroying cherished cultural sites.

The blazes are now mostly contained, but at least 53 people have died, making this one of the deadliest US wildfires in decades. The death toll is likely to rise as search and rescue efforts continue. An investigation into the cause of the fire has not yet begun, but unmanaged, nonnative grasslands are [believed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/az9?mblid=f1f211e0e28d&mbcid=32365807.4312256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to have fueled its spread, combined with dry air, drought, and winds from a passing hurricane.

“The whole town was devastated. Lāhainā was decimated,” Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke [said](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aza?mblid=b7c18c98ef93&mbcid=32365807.4312256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). At least 1,000 buildings have been wrecked.

* Front Street, the town’s popular stretch of restaurants, bars, and stores, has been reduced to [ash](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azb?mblid=09e5efccfda3&mbcid=32365807.4312256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). “Pretty much everybody I know lost everything,” one resident [told](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azc?mblid=e19d29eebf54&mbcid=32365807.4312256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) MSNBC.
* The town center—one of 60 nationally recognized historic sites in the area—was destroyed, as was the church where Christianity got its start in Hawaii in the early 1800s. Its graveyard is the burial site for some members of old Hawaiian royalty.
* The largest [banyan](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azd?mblid=79189a99f37b&mbcid=32365807.4312256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) fig tree in the US, planted in Lāhainā in 1873, is charred but still standing.

Burnt docks and wrecked boats have complicated seaborne relief efforts. Several airlines have added flights to help get people out of Maui.

**The recovery…**will take years, authorities said. Maui’s economy, which was just bouncing back after the pandemic, will suffer—80% of the island’s money is generated by tourism. Lāhainā, once the capital of pre-colonized Hawaii, was a major destination for visitors._—ML_

In exchange, the US promised to release multiple Iranians incarcerated for violating sanctions and will allow Iran to use $6 billion of frozen funds for humanitarian purposes, multiple news outlets reported. The agreement comes as a number of Americans remain in foreign prisons on dubious charges, including WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich, who is detained in Russia.

But several employees claimed they were flagged erroneously, and Amazon admitted it might be true. The company’s Slack was popping off with employees venting about what they perceived as a tone-deaf email and a lack of transparency around how the tracking worked, per Insider. When Amazon’s return-to-office policy was imposed in February, some employees walked out in protest and circulated a petition to nix it.

The price of college is rising, and for once, we can’t blame inflation. Spending [increased](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azl?mblid=4ab242a1809a&mbcid=32365807.4312256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) by 38% at the median flagship school (the best known and usually the oldest public university in each state) between 2002 and 2022—and they passed the tab to students, contributing to the $1.6 trillion student debt crisis, according to the Wall Street Journal’s analysis of the 50 schools’ financial statements.

**Driving the increase:** Over the 20 years analyzed,the median flagship’s salaries and benefits rose by \~40%, spending on athletic coaches jumped by 50%, and millions of dollars were pumped into new construction and renovations, according to data the WSJ analyzed from the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database. Administrative costs have also become a greater [share](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azm?mblid=115a21697559&mbcid=32365807.4312256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of institutional spending, per US News and the National Center for Education Statistics.

But that shiny new student union and all those higher salaries don’t pay for themselves. To afford them, every school in the Wall Street Journal’s analysis increased tuition and fee revenue per student by double digits from 2002–2022:

* At the University of Oklahoma, tuition and fees per student rose 166% in the two decades analyzed.
* Penn State, the most expensive flagship state school, costs the average student nearly $27,000 a year.

**Big picture:** Schools are spending so much because there’s no one to stop them.Economist James V. Koch found that trustees approve 98% of cost-increasing proposals at large public universities, and Holden Thorp, former chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told the WSJ that universities are just “devouring money.”—_CC_

[ ![Two headlines next to each other. One reads “New York City is dead forever” from The New York Post on August 17, 2020. The other reads “The average Manhattan rent just hit a new record of $5,588 a month” from MSNBC on August 10, 2023.](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,s0iP3Ra01kTbYVtqlIttaUOv8dHD0lO-TwcromF2vVmg/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/73bb5bea490ab527512b49d48146481e474bfd5f-1500x1000.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azq?mbcid=32365807.4312256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) _New York Post & MSNBC_ 

It wasn’t just your LA friends—everyone thought the pandemic would officially kill New York City. But apparently, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger: The city’s rents have rebounded…and then some. 

Average rents in Manhattan hit a [record high](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azr?mblid=b492864863f0&mbcid=32365807.4312256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of $5,588 in July, according to a report from Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman. It’s also the fourth month of record-breaking prices in the last five months, according to CNBC.

During the pandemic-triggered remote work revolution, economists warned that workers would flee to more affordable states and devastate the city’s real estate market. But despite nearly 400,000 people leaving Manhattan between June 2020 and June 2022, the average rent for apartments in the borough is now 30% higher than it was in 2019.

**What happened?** For starters, there’s still not enough housing on the island. And soaring interest rates are making it a lot more expensive for people to buy, so they are being pushed back into the rental market, giving prices an even bigger lift. Plus, the cost of housing in the city typically climbs throughout the summer so, spoiler alert: This month will likely break records too. 

Record rental prices show that people are choosing to live in Manhattan despite not going in to work there. Manhattan offices were only at 48% of capacity last month, according to Kastle Systems._—MM_

Mickelson has bet [more than $1 billion](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azA?mblid=97834848e0c2&mbcid=32365807.4312256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) over the last three decades on sports, losing about $100 million while doing it, according to excerpts of _Gambler: Secrets from a Life at Risk_ published by Fire Pit Collective. The author says that Mickelson made 858 wagers of $220,000 and more than 1,100 wagers of $110,000 between 2010 and 2014\. He even attempted to bet $400,000 on Team USA (which he was playing on) at the 2012 Ryder Cup.

In her first TV interview as X CEO, Linda Yaccarino stressed to CNBC that [she has autonomy](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/azB?mblid=50f2e69881a4&mbcid=32365807.4312256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) from owner Elon Musk who, despite stepping down as chief executive, still appears at times to be running the ship. Yaccarino also said that the social media company was pretty close to breaking even, advertisers including Coca-Cola and State Farm had returned, and, after gutting its workforce, X is back in hiring mode.
