Between 80 and 100 protesters have descended upon a forest in Gr√ºnheide where the expansion would happen, with some building and occupying about a dozen treehouses several meters above the ground. The environmental group Robin Wood started the ‚ÄúStop Tesla‚Äù initiative to raise awareness about the effects the expansion could have on the area‚Äôs water supply. Police said no action will be taken against the protesters through at least March 15.‚Äî_DL_

_Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even pass off a_ Dune: Part Two _viewing as educational enrichment._

ü™ê **Sci-fi takes a page from real planetary science.** Representations of faraway worlds in science fiction have actually evolved alongside the scientific community‚Äôs understanding of real-life ‚Äúexoplanets,‚Äù according to a new study. By assessing 142 sci-fi films, books, shows, and video games, including big franchises like Star Wars and Dune, researchers found that over the past 30 years, creatives have depicted fictional alien planets as [less Earth-like](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/i91?mblid=1b9600358175&mbcid=34618209.3898531&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) than in older works‚Äîaligning with scientists‚Äô discovery that most real-life planets revolving around other stars are uninhabitable (to humans, at least).

Just look up an image of a gar. Out of all the animals on Earth with jaws and backbones, this big fish has evolved _the least_ over 150 million years, meaning the gars that swim around today are almost identical to their Jurassic Period ancestors. All seven gar species were found to have the [slowest molecular evolution rate](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/i92?mblid=c7bc8ad42f77&mbcid=34618209.3898531&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of all jawed vertebrates. Scientists believe gars may have an especially strong ability to correct DNA mutations‚Ä¶something that could ultimately help researchers better understand how to cure cancer.

The findings can‚Äôt be globalized, since this is only one person‚Äôs experience, but it still challenges the common belief that overexposure to a disease germ could wear down immune cells. The researchers found out about the man after officials arrested him for fraud, thinking he was selling vax cards to other people._‚ÄîML_

_If you want to jazz up your Oscars watch party, play along with Morning Brew‚Äôs printable Academy Awards prop bets [here](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ia8?mblid=818c0bf8d55b&mbcid=34618209.3898531&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)._

Will _Oppenheimer_ win best picture? Will Robert De Niro win his first Oscar since 1981? Will Francesca Scorsese make a TikTok with her dad on the red carpet? While you ask these important questions in your most pop culture-attuned group chats, keep in mind that you could wager real money off your expectations.

Tonight‚Äôs 96th Academy Awards marks the sixth year of legal betting on Hollywood‚Äôs glitziest night‚Äîand it‚Äôs going to be a big one. Analysts are expecting record betting on this year‚Äôs Oscars due to the Barbenheimer phenomenon and another state getting in on the action.

**You can bet on the Oscars?** Yep‚Äîas of 2019, [you can legally bet](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/i97?mblid=d657ab14312b&mbcid=34618209.3898531&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) on the outcome of the televised Oscars categories, with DraftKings and FanDuel offering odds on all 23 categories‚Ä¶as long as you‚Äôre in one of the seven states where it‚Äôs legal. If you‚Äôre in Ontario, Canada, you can also make prop bets, which allow you to wager money on everything from the color of Margot Robbie‚Äôs dress to whether or not someone will get slapped on stage. (These types of situational bets are illegal in the US.)

## How we got here

In 2018, the Supreme Court struck down a law that prohibited New Jersey from legalizing gambling. That opened the floodgates for [sports betting](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8X?mblid=6ab69dadb2c0&mbcid=34618209.3898531&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)‚Ä¶and also wagering on other events, including awards shows.

* European sportsbooks had long offered Oscars betting, so American sportsbooks tried it out. FanDuel and DraftKings introduced the first legal Oscars bets in 2019, according to Variety‚Äôs _Strictly Business_ podcast.
* The success in New Jersey triggered other states to follow suit. Now, you can bet on the Oscars in Indiana, Michigan, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Kansas, and‚Äînew this year‚ÄîArizona.

**But not in Vegas?** Ironically, neither California nor Nevada has legalized Oscars wagering due to the inherent risk in betting on an event with a predetermined outcome with the potential for leaks. New Jersey saw this happen in 2019, when a rumor that Yorgos Lanthimos would win Best Director for _The Favourite_ forced FanDuel to stop offering odds on Lanthimos altogether. (Lanthimos didn‚Äôt actually end up winning.)

## A new type of gambler

Legalizing betting for a significant pop culture event gives betting companies the chance to attract new customers‚Äîpeople who aren‚Äôt interested in sports. Johnny Avello, director of race and sports operations at DraftKings, told Reuters that the company sees [greater participation from women](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/i98?mblid=2c297c2a9e81&mbcid=34618209.3898531&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) around the Oscars. ‚ÄúThey say, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to bet on football, but now you‚Äôre talking Academy Awards and now you‚Äôre in my wheelhouse,‚Äù Avello said.

But betting on the Oscars can be a very different experience from wagering on the NBA Finals:

* Bets on the Oscars are smaller. Most sportsbooks set a $1,000 maximum bet on any Oscars category bet, orders of magnitude lower than the $1 million maximum for NFL, NBA, and MLB sports bets.
* It‚Äôs more likely that people bet because they‚Äôre watching the ceremony live and want to enhance their experience. For sports, bettors more commonly watch a game _because_ they have money riding on it.

## Will betting boost the Oscars‚Äô struggling TV ratings?

Bill Speros, senior betting analyst at Bookies.com, sees legal Oscars betting as an avenue for bigger TV audiences, just as the legalization of sports betting led to higher viewerships and more fan engagement. And with its TV ratings circling the drain, the Oscars need all the help it can get.

The broadcast‚Äôs popularity has fallen dramatically from the halcyon days of _Titanic_\-era Hollywood. In 2018, the Academy Awards hit what was then an all-time low with 26.5 million viewers. Three years later, the Covid-era Oscars said ‚Äúhold my beer‚Äù with a measly 10.4 million viewers. Ratings have rebounded slightly since then, with last year‚Äôs event bringing in 18.8 million viewers. This year, with betting buzz and box-office hits, we‚Äôll take the over._‚ÄîCC_

## [Place to be: The Iditarod (unless you‚Äôre a moose)](#) 

_Photo by Lance King/Getty Images_

Most people are at least vaguely aware of Alaska‚Äôs annual Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. But before this week, few knew about Rule 34 and what it required of musher Dallas Seavey after [shooting and killing a moose](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/i94?mblid=c8814112367c&mbcid=34618209.3898531&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in self-defense along the trail.

The rule states: ‚ÄúIn the event that an edible big game animal, i.e., moose, caribou, buffalo, is killed in defense of life or property, the musher must gut the animal and report the incident to a race official at the next checkpoint.‚Äù

Seavey was dealt a two-hour penalty after race officials determined he did not gut the moose properly.

The 1,000-mile race from Anchorage to Nome that began in 1973 has other rules you won‚Äôt find anywhere else:

* **Valet tag your dog.** If a dog is determined unfit to continue at a checkpoint, it‚Äôs relocated to the closest dog collection area at Anchorage, McGrath, Unalakleet, or Nome.
* **Mandatory items.** All mushers must carry an ax, an operational cooker and pot, and eight booties for each dog.
* **No social media.** Phones can only be used for two-way communication.

The last rule was a godsend, as it guaranteed Seavey could not go live anywhere with the moose gutting.

**Looking ahead‚Ä¶**the race began on March 2 (last Saturday) and typically takes teams less than 10 days to complete.‚Äî_DL_

Last week, we asked: After the first $2 million or $3 million, a paid-off home, and a good car, there is no difference in the quality of life between you and Jeff Bezos. Do you agree?

* ‚ÄúStrong disagree. Private jets, complete immunity to healthcare costs, and the ability to donate sums that change lives are all heavy-hitting things you can‚Äôt do with $3m.‚Äù‚Äî_Spencer from Orlando, FL_
* ‚ÄúAgree 100%. Things like vacationing on a private island or a superyacht may be cool to experience, but these are not necessarily things I‚Äôm thinking of when I think of happiness.‚Äù‚Äî_Tuƒüba from New York_
* ‚ÄúBezos‚Äôs 420,000 acres probably has several views that would beat my view.‚Äù‚Äî_Anonymous_
* ‚ÄúDisagree. My quality of life will be subpar until Bo Burnham writes bops about my name instead.‚Äù‚Äî_Peter from Durham, NC_
* ‚ÄúI have a paid-off 975 sq. ft. home, a 2018 Honda CR-V, and not much spare cash. But I do have a wife (going on 49 years) who loves me, so I am richer than most millionaires!‚Äù‚Äî_Glenn from Florida_
