**Good morning**...anyone? Hello? Bueller?

Oh, that’s right. Today is August 24, the most popular day of the year for employees to call out sick, according to a survey by PTO management software company Flamingo. More American take a sick day today than on Feb. 13, America’s second sickest day of the year and one that suspiciously lines up with the day after the Super Bowl.

If this is because there was a big party last night can someone just let us know next time.

Two months after he led a revolt against the Kremlin, entrepreneurial warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s mercenary-muscle-turned-enemy, appears to have died in a plane crash north of Moscow.

Prigozhin is [listed on the private jet’s flight manifest](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b3r?mblid=101863c8989b&mbcid=32492255.3774709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), along with three crew members and six other passengers, all of whom were killed in the crash, Russian authorities said. US officials have not yet been able to verify this, and one person close to the Kremlin said Prigozhin was known to sometimes take a secondary plane out of caution.

## Was Putin behind this?

Unconfirmed reports on Telegram indicate that Russian forces shot the downed plane out of the sky, and an Associated Press analysis of videos of the plane said they appeared consistent with a mid-flight explosion. If true, it would align with widespread theories that Putin was not done punishing Prigozhin for [trying to overtake Moscow](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8DH?mblid=eb96a83da84d&mbcid=32492255.3774709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in June with his guns-for-hire army, the Wagner Group—which has played a major role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—before he took an exile deal that quickly ended the attempted mutiny.

Christo Grozev, a journalist who investigates alleged Russian plots—and correctly predicted Prigozhin’s attempted coup—told the Financial Times a couple of weeks ago, “In six months [Prigozhin will either be dead](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b3s?mblid=a5a613f3efda&mbcid=32492255.3774709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) or there will be a second coup.” Grozev’s team helped uncover the attempted assassination via nerve agent of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

Last month, President Biden nodded at the possibility of a similar outcome for Prigozhin, saying, “If I were he, I’d be careful what I ate.”

**Suspicious circumstances:** More than a dozen high-profile critics of the Russian government have [died in recent years](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b3t?mblid=4808b07c94dc&mbcid=32492255.3774709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) from apparent poisonings, defenestrations, or shootings that Russian authorities tended to investigate as suicides._—ML_

India spent less money to land a spacecraft on the moon than Warner Bros. spent to make _Gravity_.

With a reported budget of just $75 million, India’s Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft [successfully landed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b3y?mblid=5cb20689b7d5&mbcid=32492255.3774709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) on the moon’s south pole yesterday, making India the first country to reach the unexplored terrain after a Russian spacecraft crashed in the same pursuit earlier this week. Its rover will rove in hopes of locating a water supply that is easily accessible—a necessity for more advanced and long-term missions to space.

The landing instantly became an immense source of national pride and signifies India’s prowess in launching high-quality moon missions with a Kirkland-level price tag.

* The Indian Space Research Organization, which launched Chandrayaan-3, had a budget of less than $1.5 billion last fiscal year. By comparison, NASA currently has over $34 billion in budgetary resources.
* India’s $6 billion private space industry, filled with space tech startups inspired by companies like SpaceX, is expected to triple over the next two years.

People in the Midwest are welcoming the pumpkin spice latte back by slurping it in 100+ degree weather because fall starts when Starbucks decides. The PSL—now in its 20th year of being as synonymous with autumn as billowy scarves and going brunette—and the rest of the Starbucks seasonal fall menu went live today.

The iconic PSL will be joined by new menu items, including the Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai Tea Latte and the Iced Apple Crisp Oatmilk Shaken Espresso. The fall newbies highlight two industry trends:

1. **Everyone wants an iced coffee.** Both new drinks are, by default, served [over ice](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b36?mblid=5f786be36251&mbcid=32492255.3774709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), meaning three out of five of the Starbucks _fall_ drinks are intended to be cold instead of hot.Five years ago, cold drinks accounted for about 50% of all the company’s beverage sales—now they’ve jumped to 75%.
2. **R&D is watching TikTok.** The Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai Tea Latte took inspiration from a popular customization by TikTokers, who ordered from the coffee chain’s secret menu. And Starbucks isn’t the only chain getting its best ideas from 90-second videos: Chipotle added a new menu item to accommodate two quesadilla “[hacks](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b37?mblid=d395ddd47f13&mbcid=32492255.3774709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)” that went viral on TikTok.

**Stat:** Nothing brings Americans from different backgrounds together quite like half-priced apps. A [new study](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b3b?mblid=6f43ba6cbeea&mbcid=32492255.3774709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) found that the most socioeconomically diverse places in the US are chain restaurants like Applebee’s and Olive Garden, whose affordable delicacies enable cross-class mingling more than civic spaces such as schools, churches, and parks. The study also found that dollar stores and local pharmacies like CVS widen social isolation among high- and low-income people.
