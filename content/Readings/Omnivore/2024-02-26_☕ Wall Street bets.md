**Good morning.** Does the US have too many Springfields? Some are saying yes after a [tragic mixup](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hGQ?mblid=d92d9fdbd7b0&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) last week involving two different Springfields and Trader Joe’s.

On Thursday, a newspaper in Springfield, MO, wrote that a Trader Joe’s was opening in the city after a TJ’s spokesperson confirmed “plans to open a new store in Springfield.” But shortly after, the spokesperson had to apologize, saying she thought the paper was in Springfield, VA, where the store is actually opening, in a major disappointment to the Missouri Springfieldians who had long requested a Trader Joe’s.

This saga offers an opportunity to point out that Springfield is _not_ the most common city name in the US. That would be Franklin, followed by Clinton, Madison, and Washington in a three-way tie for second, per the USPS.

## [ Will Wall Street bet on Reddit? ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hGS?mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) 

[ ![In this photo illustration a Reddit logo is seen on a mobile phone screen in front of WallStreetBets (WSB) logo of a subreddit where participants discuss stock and options trading.](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,srjcPWQdpvM2-uuiiv6feqN3uer8JWeGXMDhzt8lLtu4/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/034b1b08e2a3362d3b3291fb228ca7ebc6521bd1-1024x683.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hGS?mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) _Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images_ 

The company that helped create meme stocks is becoming a stock.

Reddit [filed to go public](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hDE?mblid=a17361dec058&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) last week in an IPO that will resemble the platform itself—unusual, chaotic, and reliant on its opinionated users. Planned for next month, Reddit’s public listing will be the first social media IPO since Pinterest in 2019 and the first major tech IPO of the year.

**What’s so unusual about it?** Reddit reportedly plans to offer 75,000 of its power users the opportunity to [buy shares](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hGT?mblid=82793378e40f&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) at the IPO price, a privilege not normally afforded to individual investors. Companies going public typically sell IPO shares to professional investors, who are expected to hold the stock for long periods and lower the potential for massive swings in the share price.

## It’s an attempt to reward unpaid moderators

Reddit depends on a volunteer army of 60,000 moderators (aka “mods”) to manage its communities, known as subreddits. Though the mods are unpaid, Reddit would descend into chaos without them, and CEO Steve Huffman hopes that by giving them skin in the game, they’ll feel more like owners in the company.

Early signs indicate the mods are not appeased. Reports from [Wired](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hGU?mblid=3ab5fe764087&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) and [The Verge](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hGV?mblid=46cf37ff33a5&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) show that the Reddit IPO is being poorly received on Reddit, with the No. 1 comment on a news article of the IPO predicting, “The beginning of the end.”

**They’re probably not excited about Reddit’s financial prospects.** While it’s one of the most-visited websites in the US, Reddit has struggled to make money compared to other social media platforms. In its IPO filing, the company said it’s been unprofitable since it was founded in 2005 and pulled in $804 million in revenue in 2023 (X is projected to have made $2.5 billion last year). Its list of “risk factors” is [longer](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hGW?mblid=642179233828&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) than Facebook’s and Twitter’s combined when they filed to go public, Bloomberg Opinion’s Dave Lee noted.

**Could AI help boost sales?** Reddit, which makes most of its money through ads, aims to tap a new revenue stream—licensing its vast number of messages to train AI models. Last week, it announced a reported [$60 million per year deal](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hGX?mblid=6f47e8357262&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) with Google for AI training, and it could look to ink similar partnerships with other tech companies.—_NF_

Lithium is essential for batteries in electric cars, renewable energy storage, and even smartphones. That’s why demand for lithium is projected to grow 20x by 2040.

So when [EnergyX](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hGA?lp=text1&mbadid=cce1019f2539aa55081be33543acc226&mbadv=a&mblid=48daabf37f67&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) revealed that their technology could extract 300% more lithium than traditional methods, investors everywhere took note—General Motors included.

GM is the lead investor in EnergyX’s $50m funding round.

The victory kept Trump undefeated during primary season to date, having secured 44 of the 50 delegates available after similarly comfortable wins in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and the US Virgin Islands. Haley said she has no intention of dropping out of the race, despite it looking like a foregone conclusion that Trump will nab the GOP nomination and set up a rematch with President Joe Biden in November.

Zelensky is anxiously awaiting a decision from the Republican-led House on $60 billion in aid that he said was needed within the month. Zelensky emphasized that US assistance was not “financial support” but weapons for Ukraine’s military, such as the $1.5 billion Patriot air defense system. He said that the upcoming US elections would be a “tipping point” for how the war would end, with Trump-allied Republicans opposing more support to Ukraine.

Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu was more tempered, telling CBS that Hamas would have to abandon their “crazy demands” for a deal to be finalized. Elsewhere in the Middle East, US and UK forces carried out [another round of strikes](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hH2?mblid=15129110d28d&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) on Houthi targets in Yemen in response to the militant group’s attacks on commercial shipping.

Entertainment mogul Tyler Perry said he was [halting plans](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hH5?mblid=f7c893592666&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for an $800 million expansion of his Atlanta movie studios after seeing the capabilities of Sora, OpenAI’s jaw-dropping text-to-video model that debuted on social media less than two weeks ago. The sight of [dolphins riding bicycles](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hH6?mblid=0aa1097e5f8e&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) compelled Perry to sound an alarm about the future of filmmaking in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.

**“This will touch every corner of our industry.”** Perry sees advantages to leveraging AI in his work—less travel, fewer sets to build, more exotic locations built through text—but they don’t outweigh his concerns for everyone in the moviemaking business, from actors to crew members to transportation employees. These worries are not new: The use of AI was one of the big [sticking points](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hH7?mblid=80d842602a91&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for striking writers and actors last year, who negotiated guardrails into their new contracts.

**Is it too soon to panic?** Many filmmakers are [saying yes](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hH8?mblid=19a9789ec336&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)…for now. The technology as it exists is, at best, a replacement for stock footage, and OpenAI says it will reject requests to replicate celebrities in its videos. But even industry leaders who don’t share Perry’s level of concern for Sora concede that text-to-video technology will likely cost people their jobs in the future.—_DL_

**SCOTUS will hear arguments today that could change how social media operates.** After major social media platforms barred then-President Donald Trump’s account following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, Florida passed a law preventing the banning of political candidates, and Texas passed a similar law that said political content can’t be removed.

**Stat:** Dudes don’t often find themselves outnumbered at sporting events—except in South Korea. Women [account for 55% of fans](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hHh?mblid=199b90819dcc&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for pro sports there, per a 2022 estimate from the Korea Professional Sports Association, compared to less than half in the US and a quarter or less in Britain and Australia, the NYT reported. Analysts say the high share of women fans can be explained by a family-friendly environment at venues and the country’s high-octane fan culture, where K-pop musicians and athletes are glorified as national heroes.

## What’s in a place name?

Below is a list of places around the world that share a specific thing in common. What ties them together?

La Brea Tar Pits  
Sahara Desert  
Minnehaha Falls  
Lake Tahoe  
Mississippi River  
Milky Way Galaxy

### ANSWER

They are tautological place names, which means that two different parts of them are synonyms, or redundant. For example, Mississippi comes from “misi-sipi,” an Ojibwa word for “[big river](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hHx?mblid=b6b389db2f5f&mbcid=34469780.3936223&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).” So it’s technically “big river river.” And “la brea” means “the tar” in Spanish—giving you “the tar tar pits.”
