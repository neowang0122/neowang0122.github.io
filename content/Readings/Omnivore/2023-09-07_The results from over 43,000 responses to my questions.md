# Full Content: 

In my recent **[article](https://principles.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f817138263fa3d3dec4ad231d&id=9a07be8c9b&e=bc6bf78208)** in which I explored the declines in truth, trust, and the rule of law in the United States, I asked five questions to see what readers thought. I received more than 43,000 responses to these questions. (BTW, if you haven't read the article and replied, I'd love for you to read it and I suspect you’ll be glad you did.) 

For reference, the questions I asked were:

1. Do you trust most politicians in government to render fair judgments of other politicians and non-politicians
2. Do you believe that most Americans trust most politicians to render fair judgments of other politicians and non-politicians?
3. What do you think about those in the media? Do you think that most of those in the media are painting accurate pictures?
4. Do you think that most Americans think that most of those in the media are painting accurate pictures?
5. How do you think the legal system is working? Do you think that it’s fair?

As shown in the chart below, most people answered "no," i.e., they don't trust most politically-chosen government representatives, most people in the media, and the legal system.

I asked these questions because ==history has shown that there are increased risks, conflicts, and disobedience of the rule and law when there are big disagreements and wide-spread beliefs that the system isn't fair, such as there is now.== 

To me and those who shared their thinking with me, ==the biggest question pertaining to the internal conflict issue is== **==will there be adherence to the judgements made by those in the "system" when most people don't trust those in the system?==** 

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this issue.
