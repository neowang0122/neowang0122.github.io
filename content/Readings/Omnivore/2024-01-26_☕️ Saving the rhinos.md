**Good morning.** Want to feed your ex to a zoo animal but don’t want to wind up in a Netflix documentary? Now, you can.

Ahead of Valentine’s Day, the San Antonio Zoo is bringing back its fundraiser that allows you to name a cockroach, rat, or vegetable after your ex that’ll then be fed to its animals in exchange for a donation. Turns out spurned lovers make lucrative benefactors: Since the zoo started this tradition in 2020, it’s raised more than $225,000 in donations.

It is certainly much faster and cheaper than naming a star after your ex and waiting for it to get swallowed up by a black hole.

The list of media industry woes in just the first month of the year could fill the covers of every tabloid at the CVS checkout.

**We’ll work backward:** Yesterday, Paramount Global announced an unspecified amount of layoffs, Business Insider said it was laying off [8%](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gzL?mblid=d9aef734481b&mbcid=34127557.3978211&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of its staff, and the Forbes editorial union launched a strike through Monday before the company announced cuts. That was only half of it:

* More than [400](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gzM?mblid=22e73cf95f9c&mbcid=34127557.3978211&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) union members across Condé Nast brands—including Allure, Architectural Digest, Teen Vogue, GQ, and Vanity Fair—walked off the job on Tuesday for 24 hours to protest a potential cut of 5% of its staff (about 300 people).
* The Los Angeles Times eliminated more than [110](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gzN?mblid=0f78e8f31e99&mbcid=34127557.3978211&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) positions on Tuesday, one of the biggest cuts in the paper’s history.
* And last week, the Sports Illustrated newsroom was effectively gutted.

Oh, and Anna Wintour informed Pitchfork employees of layoffs while [wearing](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gzO?mblid=ee3d8abe9cb5&mbcid=34127557.3978211&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) her sunglasses.

\*deep breath\*

It’s not just this year—2023 saw the most media job cuts in the last 20 years, outside of recessions.

## A million reasons

Media companies once focused their energies on optimizing content for social media and search engines like Google, but these channels aren’t proving fruitful. Advertisers also started to get roasted for their ads popping up next to not-so-pleasant news coverage, so many have ditched news altogether.

And while billionaires like Marc Benioff, Jeff Bezos, and Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong showed up thinking they could turn publications like Time magazine, The Washington Post, and the LA Times around…well…they [didn’t](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gzP?mblid=a5dbe2eeb601&mbcid=34127557.3978211&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). The Washington Post alone lost about $100 million in revenue last year. 

**Don’t count on another “Trump Bump.”** Media companies [rode](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gzQ?mblid=a12cbc86ecf9&mbcid=34127557.3978211&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) Trump’s presidency—and the chaos that came with it—to higher subscriptions and page views. But that waned when Biden took office. Experts predict it won’t come back in this election cycle, either, as the public could feel more fatigued this time around._—MM_

For the year, the US economy expanded 2.5% in 2023, up from 1.9% in 2022\. That also outpaced Wall Street’s estimates from the beginning of the year. The growth was driven by strong consumer spending made possible by rising wages and a sturdy job market, even as the country dealt with inflation. That, too, improved in Q4: Prices increased 2.7% on an annual basis, down from a 5.9% increase the year prior. The GDP smash adds more fuel to the expectation that the Fed will cut interest rates this year.

The tech giant closed on its $69 billion acquisition of _Call of Duty_\-maker Activision Blizzard in October and has since made several leadership changes. CEO Bobby Kotick stepped down in December, and now Blizzard President Mike Ybarra has decided to leave, according to an internal memo obtained by The Verge. An upcoming survival game has also been canceled. The cuts come as several gaming-related companies, including Twitch, Discord, Unity, and Riot Games, have conducted layoffs.

McMahon resigned as CEO in 2022 as the company investigated allegations that he paid women to keep quiet about alleged sexual misconduct. WWE later revealed that McMahon made nearly $20 million in hush money payments to accusers. He’s currently the executive chairman of WWE’s parent company, TKO Group, which just secured a $5 billion deal to put _Monday Night Raw_ on Netflix.

Following a string of attacks on expats who used dating apps in some of Colombia’s largest cities, Tinder warned singles in the South American country this week to be wary of whom they swipe right on.

At least eight US citizens in Medellín, Colombia, [died](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gzV?mblid=f0f3f91fdbd8&mbcid=34127557.3978211&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in November and December either from suspected overdoses or homicides, often after meeting up with local women from dating apps, according to the US Embassy. Dozens of other male tourists met up with Tinder or Bumble matches and reportedly woke up hours later to find that their bank accounts had been emptied and their devices stolen. Sometimes, they’ve been beaten up.

Looks like there’s gonna be one less lonely rhino. Scientists in Berlin announced this week that they successfully transferred a rhino [embryo](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gzC?mblid=e498956feb07&mbcid=34127557.3978211&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) into the womb of a female rhino through in vitro fertilization (IVF) for the first time, marking a huge step forward in efforts to save the northern white rhino, a near-extinct subspecies.

IVF is a common process for humans, horses, and cows, but it had never been used before with rhinos. The transplant is a major win for reproductive scientists and adds to a growing list of species that could come out of extinction with the help of IVF:

* In 2022, scientists at the University of Queensland created the world’s first [donkey embryo](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gzD?mblid=30e7c5a0dfc6&mbcid=34127557.3978211&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) via IVF.

**What’s next?** Due to poaching, only two northern white rhinos are left on Earth—a mother, Najin, and daughter, Fatu. The scientists’ experiment used one of Fatu’s eggs and the preserved sperm of deceased male northern white rhinos to make the embryo. The resultant embryo was implanted in a southern white rhino, a close cousin of the northern white rhino. Now scientists will try to replicate the [procedure](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gzG?mblid=94ef71368716&mbcid=34127557.3978211&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) with one of the two remaining northern white rhinos.—_CC_

**Quote:** “It was an astonishing amount of money.”

_The White Lotus_ actor Tom Hollander is an excellent thespian in his own right, but, cruelly, he is not Spider-Man. That would be the similarly named Tom _Holland_, a fact Hollander was reminded of when he was sent Holland’s Avengers box-office bonus [by mistake](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gyJ?mblid=ac086c0c5c0b&mbcid=34127557.3978211&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). In an appearance on _Late Night With Seth Meyers_, Hollander explained that the seven-figure sum was not even the entire bonus—it was just the first one. “It’s been very difficult,” Hollander joked, “because you know I was here first but he’s enormously famous.”

**Stat:** If you’re a fully functioning human adult and your parents still hand you a 20 whenever you see them, don’t be too embarrassed. Nearly 60% of parents provided financial assistance [to their adult children](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gyK?mblid=8027cf04b145&mbcid=34127557.3978211&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in the past year, according to new research from Pew. Meanwhile, fewer than half of young adults ages 18 to 34 (45%) say they’re financially independent from mom and dad. One University of Pittsburgh economics professor found that 14% of adults receive a money transfer from their parents at least once a year—a figure that has stayed flat for years but is now continuing for longer into adulthood.

**Read:** Train heists are still a thing, thanks to the e-commerce boom. ([New York Times](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gyL?mblid=3d1508f9dd04&mbcid=34127557.3978211&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a))
