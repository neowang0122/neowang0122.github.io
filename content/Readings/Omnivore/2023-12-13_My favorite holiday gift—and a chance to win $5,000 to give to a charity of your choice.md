This holiday season, I want to show people how much better it is to give charitable gifts to the recipients' favorite charities rather than material gifts of things they don’t need. This kind of giving is in keeping with the holiday spirit and makes holiday shopping easier. I have found that giving in this way is infectiously joyous and healthy for both the giver and the receiver.

Since I want you to experience this, I’m partnering with [TisBest](https://principles.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f817138263fa3d3dec4ad231d&id=6424febef8&e=bc6bf78208) to give anyone who purchases a $50 charity gift card either one of my books or a collectible t-shirt with one of people’s favorite principles printed on it—**plus a chance to win one of three $5,000 charity gift cards to go to the charity of their choice.** Just input the code REDEFINEGIFTING at checkout (and make sure to read the terms and conditions using the link below). I hope you and those you hold dear find this kind of unique holiday gift as great and rewarding as I have!

[SHOP FOR A CHARITY GIFT CARD](https://principles.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f817138263fa3d3dec4ad231d&id=9c5eaef3ac&e=bc6bf78208 "SHOP FOR A CHARITY GIFT CARD") 

In addition, along with some of my generous friends, I will, once again, be giving away 20,000 free $50 TisBest charity gift cards with no strings attached. These can be claimed by anyone to donate to their favorite charities. We've done this every year for the last three years and the cards are a big hit both for people to use for their favorite charities or to give as a gift to someone else in their lives to give to their favorite charities. Stay tuned on social media for an announcement when the cards will be available.
