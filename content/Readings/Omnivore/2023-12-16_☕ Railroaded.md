**Good morning.** Today is the 250th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, when a group of men dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor, setting off a chain of events that ultimately led to the American Revolution.

What they don’t teach you in the history textbooks: The protest would never have succeeded if the cargo’s security guard, a bear, hadn’t slept through the entire thing on his comfy green chair.

**The two companies have been here before.** In July, Temu [filed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9wM?mblid=8214f7bb705d&mbcid=33715642.3573266&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) an antitrust lawsuit against Shein, claiming the company bullied 8,338 suppliers in China into signing loyalty agreements that banned them from making Temu products. Shein countersued, and then both companies dropped the suits in October. But the first legal battle between the two was in December of last year, when Shein sued Temu for allegedly hiring influencers to drag the company.

Now, Temu is acting like the girlfriend who always brings up your last fight during your new one. The most recent lawsuit claims Shein was still coercing suppliers with tactics like keeping them locked in meetings for hours and confiscating their phones.

* ==In November, Temu had three times more US sales than Shein.==
* ==Data from Q2 shows users  spent a daily average of 18 minutes on Temu’s app, almost double the time spent on US-based rivals like eBay and Amazon.==

**==They’re not each other’s only nemesis:==** ==With their growth in the US has come scrutiny of how they keep their prices so low, and both Shein and Temu have faced accusations of forced labor. Shein has also come under fire from designers who accuse it of stealing their IP.==_==—MM==_

The military said it was still investigating the “sad and painful event” but that it believed the three had escaped from or been abandoned by their captors. The incident comes as the US has been urging Israel to move on from its broad bombing campaign in the area to a more targeted approach to avoid civilian casualties. Israel’s war in Gaza in response to Hamas’s Oct.7 attack has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, including both civilians and combatants, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza.

You may already feel like the only person you know who didn’t post a photo from Tulum this year, but Mexico wants to make it even easier to visit the Yucatán Peninsula with a new railroad whose first segment just officially opened for business—even though many have protested its construction over fears of an environmental disaster.

Yesterday, [Tren Maya](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/flv?mblid=fc81b650c33f&mbcid=33715642.3573266&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) embarked on its first 295-mile journey from Campeche to Cancún, the vacation hot spot more than 5 million Americans visited last year. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador—who has pinned some of his reelection hopes on completing this and other infrastructure projects—says the rest of the railroad’s 950-mile loop around jungle, colonial cities, and archeological sites will start running in February.

If high-purity gold is on your shopping list alongside a 48-pack of Fruit by the Foot, Costco has you covered.

The bulk emporium recently began carrying 1-ounce gold bars, and apparently, many folks like their investment assets to feel weighty in their hand. Costco customers [bought $100 million worth](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/flD?mblid=57ab24b2bf46&mbcid=33715642.3573266&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of gold bars last quarter, CFO Richard Galanti said on an earnings call this week.

## Where the gold at?

The South African-made bars [were going](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/flE?mblid=9d01253a54f8&mbcid=33715642.3573266&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for $2,069.99 as of yesterday, just about 35 bucks above the price at the time of writing for 1 ounce of gold on the market. But before you rush to the nearest Costco location…

* The bullion is available exclusively online, and only Costco members can order them.
* There’s a limit of two per person, and, unlike [many other](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/flF?mblid=71b63f5aa139&mbcid=33715642.3573266&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) Costco goodies, you can’t return them.

If you decide to seek out this treasure, don’t wait around: They typically sell out fast and are often out of stock.

**Zoom out:** The price of gold briefly [breached $2,100](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/eQb?mblid=5ebcfc53aaad&mbcid=33715642.3573266&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)/ounce for the first time ever earlier this month as analysts expect that the Fed might start cutting interest rates in the spring and that the dollar will weaken.

**Stat:** While baby boomers have a reputation for criticizing younger people’s work ethic, they might want to direct those complaints in the other direction, since it looks like boomers are working harder—or at least [longer](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/flJ?mblid=2defec39fe95&mbcid=33715642.3573266&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)—than the generations before them. The share of Americans age 65+ working this year was almost double that of 35 years ago, according to the Pew Research Center (19% in 2023, compared to 11% in 1987). The flexibility that technology allows, as well as changes to Social Security and the shift from pensions to 401(k)s, are all believed to have contributed to boomers staying in the office longer rather than moving to Boca.

**Quote:** “I’ve been told that slaying dragons will get you burned. But in light of today’s victory and the importance of doing what is needed for a free and honest press—it’s a worthwhile price to pay.”

Best-selling author Prince Harry waxed poetic after scoring a [legal win](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/flK?mblid=cf2ad444fdb4&mbcid=33715642.3573266&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) against his sworn enemy, the UK tabloids. A London court ruled that Mirror Group Newspapers had illegally hacked Harry’s phone to get information for stories it published, and awarded him damages. The ruling comes as a part of a sprawling case against the tabloid publisher, during which Harry became the first senior member of the royal family to testify in court in 130 years. He still has other privacy cases pending against UK publishers.
