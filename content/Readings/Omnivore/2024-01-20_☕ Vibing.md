**Good morning.** Why do so many Americans think they live in the Midwest when they don’t actually live in the Midwest?

According to data from Emerson College Polling and the Middle West Review…

* More than 30% of people from Montana, 42% from Colorado, 54% from Wyoming, and 27% from Arkansas say they live in the Midwest.
* Those people are wrong, says the US Census Bureau, which generally considers the Midwest to include 12 states: the Dakotas, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio.

This was inevitable after the Big Ten decided to accept Rutgers…

Soaring tech stocks helped the S&P blow past both intraday and closing records set in January 2022.

## [ Americans no longer hate the economy ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gmX?mbcid=34063705.3513175&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)

The Ministry of Economic Enthusiasm has proclaimed that the Great Vibecession is officially over. Okay, that’s not a real government body, but the economic vibes really have improved: US consumer sentiment just made its [biggest two-month jump](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gmY?mblid=5bf1a686c1ed&mbcid=34063705.3513175&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) since 1991, the University of Michigan said yesterday.

The university’s consumer sentiment index offers a monthly snapshot of how Americans feel about their finances, business conditions, and what the future holds. And with the job market going strong and inflation on the decline, Americans haven’t felt this good about the economy since summer 2021…

* In the first half of this month, the consumer sentiment reading jumped 13.1% from December, putting it 29% above where it was in November.
* Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the coming year dropped to 2.9% from 3.1% in December, the lowest since late 2020.

Analysts say lower gas prices and mortgage rates and a stock market rebound helped boost the mood.

## Vibes matter

Since consumer spending is such a large chunk of the US GDP, Americans’ gut feelings are closely watched by experts who consider them an important gauge of overall economic health. And they’re now more in line with the relatively strong economy on paper after months of headlines about how everyone still felt gloomy.

It’s possible no one wants to know how you feel about this more than the Fed. Inflation expectations factor majorly into the central bank’s interest rate decisions, and this month’s improved inflation outlook makes it more likely that they’ll start cutting soon.

Getting consumers smiling is also a big priority for the White House—especially since the president is running for reelection. The vast majority of Americans consider economic issues among their top concerns when voting, according to a recent [Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gmZ?mblid=90b5a550798c&mbcid=34063705.3513175&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)survey.

It’s the latest automaker to hit the brakes on EV plans in the face of slow sales even as the government tries to nudge drivers toward them. Meanwhile, the CEO of rival automaker Stellantis cautioned against cutting EV prices too fast—which he said Tesla has already done—warning of an industry “bloodbath.”

The $3,499+ headset is Apple’s first major product category launch since 2015, when it made everyone think they needed a watch that told them to stand up. But unlike when it debuted the Apple Watch, the company’s rollout of the Vision Pro has [the vibe](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gnA?mblid=1b2fde0575d6&mbcid=34063705.3513175&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of “No worries if not!”:

* There won’t be any official product launch events, and there’s a lot less hype from celebs.
* Analysts only expect the company to sell about 400,000 units this year. In comparison, Apple sold 12 million (significantly cheaper) Apple Watches the year they were first offered.

**Some third-party apps also seem pretty meh about it.** Spotify, Netflix, and YouTube said they won’t be making apps specifically for the device as of its launch. However, Slack, TikTok, and _Candy Crush_ will be [available](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gng?mblid=be351db320ca&mbcid=34063705.3513175&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

**Still, consumers seem ready to strap it to their faces.** Most stores offering the Vision Pro sold out for in-store pickup already, and the delivery date for online preorders has been pushed back from February 2 to at least March 8, suggesting they’ve been selling fast or don’t have enough to meet demand. And that’s despite the multistep buying process of having to scan your head and submit your vision prescription._—MM_

In hopes of winning over workers in a competitive labor market, America’s largest one-stop-shop for tires and eggs is ramping up store managers’ [average pay](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gna?mblid=00a4073edb5d&mbcid=34063705.3513175&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for the first time in more than a decade, the company told CNN.

Walmart announced this week that, effective February 1 in the US…

* The average manager’s salary will get a 9% [boost](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gn7?mblid=795df595b709&mbcid=34063705.3513175&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to $128k, while the low end of the range will jump from $65k to $90k. Their maximum bonuses will also increase from 150% of their base pay to 200%.
* The retail chain, which employs 1.6 million people in the US, will raise frontline hourly workers’ average wages from $17.50 to $18.

**Why the raise?** It’s likely [another attempt](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gn8?mblid=b20ab29567a2&mbcid=34063705.3513175&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to boost retention, recruiting, and maybe—with [unionization efforts](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gn9?mblid=3c0c715f5e2b&mbcid=34063705.3513175&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) happening at other big-box stores—employee satisfaction. Walmart job perks include healthcare and free college tuition, and the company already increased its minimum hourly pay by $2 to nearly double the federal minimum wage last year when the labor market was red-hot.

**Stat:** Japan’s lunar robot explorer, known by the perfect superhero nickname “Moon Sniper,” made it to [the moon](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gnk?mblid=915574ffb934&mbcid=34063705.3513175&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) yesterday. That makes Japan the fifth nation to touch down there after the US, the Soviet Union (now Russia), China, and India. Like most snipers, it was going for precision aim: While most previous moon visitors have had \~10-kilometer-wide (six-mile-wide) landing zones, Moon Sniper was trying to hit a spot within just 100 meters (330 feet). But it might turn out to be more about the journey than the destination, since the lander ended up unexpectedly low on power and may have its mission cut short.

**Quote:** “The new edition does not include a ban on humor or pop culture references on changeable message signs.”

The Federal Highway Administration wants you to know it’s not totally humorless. The agency recently sparked disappointment from anyone who’s ever chuckled while on a road trip at a sign that read “I’m just a sign asking a driver to use turn signals” by discouraging states from using jokes or cultural nods in highway signs in its latest guidelines.
