早上听了Walker采访World renowned AI expert, McKinsey Digital senior partner Rodney Zemmel, talked about his WSJ best selling new book, some key points:

1. Lots of benefits of AI 🌊, here are some downsides: 70% of resources misspent and wasted. AI-biased due to training materials being biased. AI hallucination/crazy imagination But the most worrisome is AI Fake, almost impossible to tell the differences. So in future, aside from setting guardrails/laws, also people’s trust is based on the sources of the news
2. Before, AI was more specific ie expert system type, however since last year or so LLMs enable Generative AI, one model apply to different real world scenarios
3. AI train 🚂 is still on very early stage, the way to do business is being transformed by AI, just getting started, better hoop on or risk of being left behind in station
4. Must be top down driven from the top of the company, setup goal and have roadmap with achievable objectives, but based on the McKinsey data, only about 1/3 is getting financially reward as a result not, many companies over spent on technology but marginal results
5. Only large companies have resources to build their own LLMs, many more will use off the shelf and then modify to suit their own needs
6. Data found many LLM models converge/behave similarly, due to common training materials
7. Companies roadmaps should break into 3-6 months/2-5 smaller projects chunks, with realistic deliverables, to check on result at each small milestone, not 2-3 year huge grand plan…
8. Many traditional companies also changing their recruiting strategies: instead of hiring ITs mainly for maintenance, now looking for tech talents with real rewarding career path with internal growth and leadership opportunities (听到这里，给CS毕业但就业市场鸭梨山大的童鞋们一点建议，不要光👀着高科技公司，传统行业也需要人才￼）
9. A new database built by McKinsey Digital, basically consolidate 42 internal databases at McKinsey, use GenerativeAI to sort out all user cases In McKinsey, for any problem faced by clients, can provide 4-5 internal McKinsey experts and best practices, can be pulled by any McKinsey associates
10. AI at this early stage, mainly for automated boring tasks to improve efficiency. Adopting AI on business, is a journey/process and not an overnight miracle, still very early, hoop on anytime ￼￼￼￼
