**Good morning and Happy Groundhog Day.** Our nation’s rodent prophet laureate, Punxsutawney Phil, will deliver his weather forecast today, and if you’re unsure what to wager in the office pool, here are some historical Phil stats to help, per the York Daily Record. Since 1887…

* Phil has predicted longer-lasting winters 107 times and early springs 20 times, while for 10 years we don’t have records and once he was a no-show. That means he’s forecast longer winters in 84% of his known predictions.
* He’s also called for longer winters for the past three years.

We like the over(bite).

Tech enthusiasts and/or their assistants are spending this morning like it’s 2007: lined up outside Apple Stores for the new gadget that’s supposed to change everything.

The long-awaited Vision Pro [hits Apple’s shelves](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gQo?mblid=5dc891b78e1d&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in the US today. While early reviews are mixed, the Vision Pro still has the potential to deliver wearable tech’s “iPhone moment”…if Apple can convince customers that its device is worth $3.5k and the immeasurable price of looking like you just got your eyes dilated.

**This could be a turning point for the entire tech industry.** Despite the best efforts of companies like Meta and Samsung, augmented-, virtual-, and mixed-reality headsets [haven’t taken off](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fu4?mblid=b2de1f22ddf1&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) as anything more than novelty gadgets for gamers. Apple thinks it can be the one to change this by marketing the Vision Pro as a must-have tool for both work and play that will usher in an era of what Apple calls “spatial computing,” aka working in a 3D virtual space instead of on a computer (think Tony Stark in his garage).

It’s possible that Apple has already sold \~180k headsets in [preorders](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gne?mblid=4f0433efe795&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), but it only expects to sell 400,000 total units this year. Still, that equates to $1.4 billion in sales.

## What it’s like to use the Vision Pro

The headset comes with 600 specialized apps but is crucially missing Meta, Netflix, Spotify, Google, and YouTube. _Avatar_ director and technology shaman James Cameron nonetheless called his demo a “religious” experience, while other reviewers who got [early access](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gQp?mblid=28c9ad7ae472&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) let out some “oohs” and “aahs,” along with caveats:

* **Pros:** The 23-million-pixel visuals, namely Vision Pro’s immersive content and theater mode, really are all that, according to [John Gruber](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gQq?mblid=d722dcc32269&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). Navigating the screen with your eyes is pretty cool, too, [Casey Newton](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gQr?mblid=6be51b8a40ef&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) wrote.
* **Cons:** Downsides include the virtual keyboard, the killjoy battery pack, isolation (it’s a one-person device), a potentially minimal effect on productivity, and size/weight (it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro, according to [The Verge](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gQp?mblid=be3e982b3e2d&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)).

**Is there no going back?** After trying out the Vision Pro, some reviewers said their regular 2D devices felt outdated._—ML_

According to the UN, since Oct. 7, there have been at least 500 attacks, which have killed at least eight Palestinians. The order allows the Biden administration to freeze settlers’ US assets and bank accounts and leaves the door open to sanction Israeli politicians. It came down shortly before President Biden celebrated his UAW endorsement in Michigan, a state with a large population of Arab Americans, many of whom have been angered by his support of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.

Commercial real estate has been on the struggle bus since the pandemic hit in 2020, and now it’s taking regional banks along for the ride.

Yesterday, New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) shares took an 11% tumble—on top of a [38% plunge on Wednesday](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gQw?mblid=360d716f973d&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)—after the bank said it’s dealing with surging losses from office buildings and multifamily apartment buildings. It’s a sign that commercial real estate (CRE) lenders are reckoning with the fact that they [might not get their money back](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gQx?mblid=7f1c8e69d7a0&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) as commercial landlords struggle with high vacancies and interest rates:

* More than $2.2 trillion in US commercial property loans will come due by 2027, according to the Wall Street Journal.
* The default risk is worse for regional banks, where CRE loans make up nearly 29% of all assets, versus 6.5% at big national banks.

**Deja vu?** The KBW Regional Banking Index dropped 9.2% since Wednesday, the most since [Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gQy?mblid=0e569cf472da&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) last year. (Coincidentally, most of the assets of Signature Bank, which failed shortly after SVB, were bought by NYCB.)

**Zoom out:** It’s not just a problem in the US. A small bank in Tokyo and another in Switzerland also reported troubles this week.—_CC_

The Las Vegas Sphere is ready to jam. Dead & Company will be the Sphere’s third residency starting in May, the band [announced](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gPF?mblid=94eb48ed179a&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) yesterday, accompanied by a video of the $2.3 billion orb wrapped in one of the many Grateful Dead logos.

The group, which includes Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart alongside early aughts villain and guitar virtuoso John Mayer (and others), just finished what they said was their final tour last year. But this residency isn’t technically a tour—it’s a mere 18-show Sin City installation, joining a growing list of dad-friendly rockers that includes Phish and U2.

## There’s a lot going on in Vegas

Even more than usual. Earlier this week, the owner of the historic Tropicana Las Vegas hotel and casino [said](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gPG?mblid=85cbd659a1c7&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) it would be torn down after six decades to make way for the new $1.5 billion stadium for Major League Baseball’s ~~Oakland~~ Athletics. 

Meanwhile, this month’s Super Bowl is expected to help smash December’s record-setting \~$1.4 billion raked in by the city’s casinos.

## [ Key performance indicators ](#)

**Quote: “**I’m sorry, but there aren’t a lot of smart executives anymore...y’all aren’t creative people. Stick to the money.”

_Insecure_ co-creator and star Issa Rae, as her recent [Time magazine profile](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gPL?mblid=fc75d55e666d&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) put it, did not mince words in her assessment of modern Hollywood executives. Rae, whose edgy Max comedy series _Rap Sh!t_ was canceled last month after two seasons, said the network’s parent company, WarnerMedia, would never greenlight a show like that now because execs play it way too safe. Her comments came a day after _Dune_ director Denis Villeneuve, in a Time profile [of his own](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gPM?mblid=211101545226&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), came to a similar conclusion about Hollywood decision-making. “We’re in a very conservative time; creativity is restricted,” he said. “Everything’s about Wall Street. What will save cinema is freedom and taking risks.”

**Stat:** Rates of syphilis in the US haven’t been this high [since the 1950s](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gPN?mblid=a63d0f575e78&mbcid=34206493.3953818&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). Per the CDC, cases of the sexually transmitted infection are up almost 80% since 2018, continuing a long-running trend across every age group. Cases of congenital syphilis, when a mother passes an infection to the fetus, have skyrocketed 937% in the last decade. Experts say increases in substance use, decreasesin condom use, and fewer sexual health clinics are to blame. The CDC also said the burden that the Covid-19 pandemic put on public health resources likely exacerbated the issue. It’s not all bad news, though: Cases of gonorrhea fell 9% in 2022, the first decline in a decade.
