**Good morning.** We expect this email will find more of you in your PJs than usual, since 16.1 million employees are expected to take off work the day after the Super Bowl, according to the UKG Workforce Institute. In all, 14% of US employees plan to miss at least some work on “Super Sick Monday,” including the NFL script writers, who just wrapped up one of their most memorable seasons ever and deserve some PTO.

* **Markets:** With its record close on Friday, the S&P 500 accomplished something it hadn’t done since 1972: rise in [14 out of the last 15 weeks](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8Y?mblid=363659b9aa73&mbcid=34314159.3972126&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). All three major indexes are coming off five straight winning weeks thanks to strong corporate earnings and optimism around the economy.
* **Stock spotlight:** Verizon has started the year just fine, but it could swing to a loss in Q1 after paying Beyoncé for a full-minute Super Bowl ad. Following the spot, the superstar dropped two singles and [announced a new album](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h9A?mblid=e5a927b5945c&mbcid=34314159.3972126&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

### STOCKS

## [ The S&P 500 enters its 5,000 era ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8Z?mbcid=34314159.3972126&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)

When the bell rings to open the stock market this morning, it’ll mark the [first time](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8-?mblid=48e670fd7133&mbcid=34314159.3972126&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the S&P 500, an index that tracks the largest companies in the US, begins the trading day above 5,000 points.

**Why is 5,000 important?** Besides the cool fact that “five thousand” contains no letter of the alphabet more than once, it’s a symbolic milestone that reflects investors’ jubilation over a US economy that has continued to expand even as interest rates have soared, defying the odds.

The latest surge has been [dizzying](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8%5F?mblid=13c0b79229d1&mbcid=34314159.3972126&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), with the S&P rallying 20% from early November. The index has doubled since September 2017, when it was at 2,500\. 

**Your stock portfolio is probably looking flush.** The S&P 500 is the most widely tracked index in the world, and as of 2022, investors had \~$11.4 trillion in investments passively indexed to the S&P or funds that use it as a benchmark, per S&P Global.

## AI fever has powered the rally

While the S&P contains 500 companies, it’s really just seven huge tech stocks—the so-called “Magnificent Seven”—contributing most of the gains. These companies, which include Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia, [account for 29%](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h90?mblid=57701c3d291e&mbcid=34314159.3972126&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of the total weighting of the index, and their sway has only increased as investors bet they’ll emerge as the winners of the AI revolution.

* But might it become the “Sensational Six”? Some traders are questioning whether Tesla [should be dropped](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h91?mblid=b69a174bda9f&mbcid=34314159.3972126&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) from the club since the EV-maker has slid 22% to start the year.

**Big picture:** The ripping stock market is beginning to leave its imprint on the real world. Tech employees seeing their stock awards surge in value have helped [rejuvenate](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h92?mblid=ca54e9bff1ba&mbcid=34314159.3972126&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) a moribund real estate market in Silicon Valley, with San Jose homes selling at the fastest pace of any major US metro. And more boomers appear to be comfortable enough with their retirement funds to clock out once and for all—thanks to a [recent spike](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h93?mblid=817d8a6524c1&mbcid=34314159.3972126&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in retirements, the US has 2.7 million more retirees than predicted by the St. Louis Fed.—_NF_

What’s the book every corporate executive is reading these days? The thesaurus, as bosses hunt for synonyms of “you’re fired” to ease the blow for their laid-off employees and avoid criticism online.

Companies are [dropping](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h98?mblid=e78bb32c3a76&mbcid=34314159.3972126&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the harsh-sounding “fired” from their vocabulary and replacing it with euphemisms like “involuntary career event” and “rightsizing,” even though it doesn’t change the outcome.

* Citi described cutting 20,000 jobs in November as creating a “simplified operating model.”
* UPS said its 12,000 layoffs were an attempt to “fit our organization to our strategy.”

Speaking to Bloomberg, Stanford professor Robert Sutton compared this use of soft language to “jargon monoxide,” which is intended to assuage the person receiving the ax but may have the opposite effect.

**A reaction to social media backlash.** Of the tens of thousands of people laid off so far this year, some have filmed themselves receiving the bad news and posted the awkward conversation on social media, sending the TikTok hashtag #layoffs to nearly 400 million views. Former Cloudflare employee Brittany Pietsch’s [nine-minute video](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h99?mblid=7e18fa477f80&mbcid=34314159.3972126&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in which she was laid off went viral in January, an example of what companies are desperate to avoid when firing (or task-based income displacing) an employee.—_DL_

**Quote:** “I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want.”

GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump said on Saturday that, when he was president, he told leaders of NATO countries he would [look the other way](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h9g?mblid=1a5aaee46cc6&mbcid=34314159.3972126&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) if Russia were to invade an ally he felt wasn’t spending enough on defense. When Trump was in office in 2017, he was initially critical of the agreement’s Article 5 clause, which states an attack on any NATO member will be treated as an attack against all members, before reversing course. But the US’ commitment to its NATO allies will come into question again if Trump retakes the White House, particularly after his speech raised alarm on both sides of the Atlantic. The White House called Trump’s comments “appalling and unhinged,” and the head of NATO said his suggestion “undermines all of our security.”
