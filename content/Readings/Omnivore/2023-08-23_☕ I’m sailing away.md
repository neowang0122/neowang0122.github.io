**Good morning.** Morning Brew is offering a new course that will have managers running their teams as smoothly as a Nic Cage-led expedition to steal a historical document.

You think Benjamin Franklin Gates just _guesses_ when he assigns someone a task? That he tells the computer guy who looks like Ed Snowden to knock some skulls? Or fails to utilize Dr. Abigail Chase’s archival expertise? Of course not. Gates knows that everyone on his team brings a different skill set to the table and puts them in the right seats for success.

To get your team to that level of execution, check out [Building High-Performance Teams](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b0V?mblid=4170a827417d&mbcid=32480689.4272982&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). It’s a one-week virtual course to help managers build trust among their reports, hire the right people to fill gaps, and provide useful feedback. It begins on Aug. 28, so don’t miss out.

\*Stock data as of market close, cryptocurrency data as of 2:00am ET.[Here's what these numbers mean.](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/s1?mbcid=32480689.4272982&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) 

* **Markets:** A rough August for the S&P 500 [didn’t get any better](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b0W?mblid=e0b935bbd2f5&mbcid=32480689.4272982&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) yesterday. Shares of US banks fell after several regional lenders were hit with a credit downgrade. And retailers, which you’ll read about in a bit, have a glut of products that aren’t selling. In a sign of those consumer worries, Nike shares notched their longest losing streak ever, falling for the ninth straight day.

Tomorrow, Japan will begin a decadeslong [process](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b0Y?mblid=9c6e88a74921&mbcid=32480689.4272982&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of releasing treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean.

Japanese officials say it’s a necessary step to decommission the plant, which was wrecked in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami there and suffered a nuclear disaster. For the past 12 years, hundreds of underground tanks have stored roughly 1.34 million metric tons of contaminated water from the nuclear plant and releasing the water into the ocean is considered the most feasible option.

**It’s become a major controversy in the region.** In July, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), cleared the Japanese government’s plan to dump the water in the ocean. But neighboring countries, environmental activists, and the seafood industry are urging Japan to find an alternative.

* In Japan, which exported $2 billion worth of fish in 2022, seafood workers are worried that this move will cause reputational harm and cost them their livelihoods.
* South Korea and China, the biggest importers of Japanese seafood, have already banned fish imports from Fukushima.

## Baby, there’s tritium in the water

Japan says it’s filtered out all the radioactive elements in the water…except one: tritium. This element that can’t be filtered (only diluted) has become the main point of tension around the plan. 

Opponents warn of the potential harm of releasing tritium, which emits radiation, but supporters say that disposing of nuclear wastewater with minimal amounts of tritium has been done before in Japan and other countries.

* The [released water](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b0Z?mblid=b7ff525d6ae5&mbcid=32480689.4272982&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) will contain 190 becquerels of tritium per liter, far below the World Health Organization’s safety limit of 10,000 becquerels per liter for drinking water, according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company.
* Two plants in the UK release between 400 and 2,000 terabecquerels of tritium into the ocean every year. Plants in Japan also discharged terabecquerels of tritium before the Fukushima accident.

But critics, including the US National Association of Marine Laboratories, argue that there are still unanswered questions and a lack of evidence about the safety of the water.

**Looking ahead…**after the discharge begins, Japan plans to test seawater and fish near the plant starting as early as next month. But disposing of all the water is expected to take between 30 and 40 years.—_CC_

Ikea is banking on it. Today, the furniture seller is [opening](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b16?mblid=959d7b55c39b&mbcid=32480689.4272982&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) a smaller-scale format of its iconic store in a downtown SF mall even after dozens of other retailers have said ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/18x0,sJGFi_mXC2H4RBVTwpF5cncyCr06ruRXRLr-rN6y0mHA/https://em-content.zobj.net/thumbs/120/apple/237/victory-hand_270c.png) to the struggling area.

Like the company’s relationship-ending nightstand assembly directions, its 2020 announcement that it would occupy a three-floor store in an abandoned mall was hard to comprehend. At least 150,000 office workers abandoned San Francisco during the pandemic, and nearly 40 stores have shut down in the city’s Union Square area over the last three years, according to Coresight. 

Still, the new store’s manager [told](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b17?mblid=fcb42b244180&mbcid=32480689.4272982&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the WSJ, “We do feel it’s a viable place.”

**Trust the process:** The new SF store is one of at least 17 stores Ikea plans to open in the US by 2026 in a $2.2 billion expansion push. Some of those locations will be mini Ikeas in downtowns that focus on selling Tvärfot table lamps to impecunious unpaid interns who don’t have much apartment space to fill.

* These compact stores are performing well in cities like London, Mumbai, and Paris, Ikea said.
* But in December 2022, the company shuttered its Queens, NY, location—its first attempt at a store in a dense, urban environment in the US.

Ikea’s arrival is a relief for a city that some critics say could enter a “doom loop.” But signs of life are popping up: The excitement around AI is starting to [bring workers back](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b18?mblid=0c5ab36e29e2&mbcid=32480689.4272982&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) into SF’s desolate offices.—_MM_

Sailing the high seas may give off _Master and Commander_ vibes, but it’s coming back in 2023 as an innovative way to lower commercial shipping’s carbon footprint.

A cargo ship retrofitted with solid wing sails [embarked](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1d?mblid=6d92b6d11b1b&mbcid=32480689.4272982&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) on a trial voyage earlier this week, chartered by food giant Cargill for a fuel-efficient journey from China to Brazil. A UK company started by yacht racing pros, BAR Technologies, designed the so-called WindWings tech.

How it works:

* Two [foldable sails](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1e?mblid=b2fddbd66b7f&mbcid=32480689.4272982&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) made from wind-turbinelike material were installed atop the bulk cargo vessel Pyxis Ocean and stand 123 feet above deck when raised.
* Those sails enable a ship to harness sea wind for propulsion, reducing fossil fuel use by up to 20%.

The concept could be a game changer for the shipping industry, which relies primarily on oil-powered vessels and spits out [around 3%](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1f?mblid=8fe6b9e0726a&mbcid=32480689.4272982&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of global carbon emissions. That existing ships can be modified to breeze along with the winds is particularly promising for making old gas guzzlers cleaner.

**But this tech faces some headwinds.** It’s unclear whether WindWings will be commercially viable before we all hit the age when a cruise becomes the go-to vacation: Cargill [expects](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b1g?mblid=9771f06ad882&mbcid=32480689.4272982&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) it’ll take at least seven to 10 years for fuel savings to surpass the cost of installing the sails on the Pyxis Ocean._—SK_

SBF’s lawyers said his requests for his prescription medication (Adderall and an antidepressant) were denied, and, if that continues, SBF will be “severely negatively impacted in his ability to assist in his own defense.” SBF’s fraud trial over the collapse of the crypto exchange he founded, FTX, is set to begin in October.
