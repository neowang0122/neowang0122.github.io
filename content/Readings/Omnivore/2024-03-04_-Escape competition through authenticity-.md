### =="No one can compete with you on being you"==

==That was written by Naval Ravikant in 2018.== It stuck with me through all these years and was just recently resurfaced through [readwise](https://substack.com/redirect/7f93143d-d44d-4d7d-bad8-60187b268aa4?j=eyJ1IjoiMnkycXRhIn0.nuzIT9a4BeQSNYg8gdQVbZ5ZSwrFjuJ7f2hzSpwFB-Y). 

The beauty of that quote is that it applies to so much in our lives, from relationships to careers. 

And I think it's extra relevant now, in the age of AI. 

==AI may outwrite and outwork us, but it lacks our ability to truly connect with others.==

## Monthly Picks

_A handful of new finds that I think are worth sharing._ 

**==Movie -==** ==The Stronghold - One of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's crime movie set in Marseille, France.== It’s based on a true story, and criminally(😉) underrated on IMDb. 

**==App -==** ==[Spacedrive](https://substack.com/redirect/38bbd697-667f-444d-a5c9-a9477a28e0d8?j=eyJ1IjoiMnkycXRhIn0.nuzIT9a4BeQSNYg8gdQVbZ5ZSwrFjuJ7f2hzSpwFB-Y)== ==- Keeping an eye on this as it develops (currently in alpha).

**Clothing** \- [This](https://substack.com/redirect/5dbe5987-1002-426c-93ab-9e9f0a27bc31?j=eyJ1IjoiMnkycXRhIn0.nuzIT9a4BeQSNYg8gdQVbZ5ZSwrFjuJ7f2hzSpwFB-Y) cardigan from Massimo Dutti was probably my best clothing purchase in a while. And I paid full price. It looks and feels as good, if not better, than those from higher end brands that add a 0 to the price.

That's all I found worthy of sharing.

Thanks for reading :)
