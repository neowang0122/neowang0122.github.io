# Full Content: 

 I just went through this process after reading this thread. I used `frontmatter` / Python for most of the heavy lifting. The only thing I couldn't do with that is to order the keys in the YAML, for which I used the Obsidian Linter plugin.

 The whole process was fun and enjoyable and allowed me to refresh my python skills (tip: work on a copy of your notes first). If I had tried to do it manually I would have been completely draining and miserable.

 Between python, bash and the Linter plugin you can pretty much do anything.
