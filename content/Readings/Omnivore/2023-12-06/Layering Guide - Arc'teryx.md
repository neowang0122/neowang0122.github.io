## Highlights

> ## First Layer
> 
> Your first layer, worn next-to-skin to provide warmth and quickly move moisture away from your skin.
> 
> Lighter weights are best for warm conditions and/or high output levels. Heavier weights for cool conditions or lower output.
> 
> **Wool** retains its warmth when wet and has natural anti-odor properties.
> 
> **Synthetics** are lightweight, dry quickly and can be more abrasion resistant. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/layering-guide-arc-teryx-18c4297f4f2#4dbe94e4-07a1-4444-9486-5eafeab62f1d)  ^4dbe94e4

> ## Insulation & Fleece
> 
> Insulation & fleece provide warmth while also dissipating heat during periods of high output. When selecting insulation type, consider weight and weather conditions.
> 
> **Down** provides the highest warmth-to-weight value and packs small, but it is best suited to cool and dry conditions.
> 
> **Synthetic** materials remain warm when damp, are more abrasion resistant but less compact and heavier than down.
> 
> **Fleece** is a thermal garment with high air permeability. Fleece offers high comfort, but less weather resistance when worn as a standalone layer. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/layering-guide-arc-teryx-18c4297f4f2#13a7e5c8-fc5e-48fa-a707-16788ea8e8e1)  ^13a7e5c8

> ## Outer Layer
> 
> Shells are the most weather protective layer, most often worn on the outside of all other layers. Evaluate your environment, expected output level and typical conditions when making your selection.
> 
> **GORE-TEX** shells are fully waterproof, windproof and breathable.
> 
> **Windshells** are lighter weight, wind and weather resistant. Best suited to dry conditions, or minimal precipitation.
> 
> **Softshell** refers to a four-way stretch textile with a durable weather resistant outer surface.
> 
> **Waterproof Insulated Jackets** combine insulation and a weather protecting outer layer into a single layer. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/layering-guide-arc-teryx-18c4297f4f2#eac7e560-e84f-4da4-9791-e65ed231d333)  ^eac7e560

## Why Layering?

Layers are the instruments of keeping you dry, warm and using your energy efficiently. Put into the right systems, a good sequence of layers moves moisture away from your skin, conserves or dissipates heat and provides you with weather protection.

Proper layering also permits textiles to move freely over each other, so you don’t experience restriction or chafing. Having an efficient system means more time outdoors, staying warm and dry while safely and comfortably pursuing your activities of choice.

## ==First Layer==

## Outer Layer

Shells are the most weather protective layer, most often worn on the outside of all other layers. Evaluate your environment, expected output level and typical conditions when making your selection.

**GORE-TEX** shells are fully waterproof, windproof and breathable.

**Windshells** are lighter weight, wind and weather resistant. Best suited to dry conditions, or minimal precipitation.

**Softshell** refers to a four-way stretch textile with a durable weather resistant outer surface.

**Waterproof Insulated Jackets** combine insulation and a weather protecting outer layer into a single layer.
