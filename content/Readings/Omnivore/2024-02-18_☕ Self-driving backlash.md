The effects of COVID-19 are still rippling through the hiring market. But what exactly does that impact look like? It can be hard to tell from year to year.

That’s why CareerBuilder partnered with Morning Consult to create the [_State of Hiring and Retention_ report](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hqi?lp=text1&mbadid=76253f12084633cafb14092d229d2619&mbadv=a&mbcid=34377952.3914737&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

They surveyed 400 hiring decision-makers, and here’s a glimpse of their findings:

* 60% of hiring managers said improving the quality of new hires is a recruiting priority.
* 53% said they’ve recently had to change their offer package to entice new employees.
* Top retention tactics include competitive pay raises + schedule/location flexibility.

[The report](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hqi?lp=text2&mbadid=76253f12084633cafb14092d229d2619&mbadv=a&mbcid=34377952.3914737&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) details how offer packages are changing, today’s top recruiting tools, and how employees are handling return-to-office policies.

The [hybrid beef-rice](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hpW?mblid=3b534b6085c5&mbcid=34377952.3914737&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)—which has higher nutritional content than regular rice thanks to the addition of bovine muscle and fat cells—is said to taste nuttier and feel harder than its conventional counterpart. There’s only 7% more protein per 100-gram serving (about the same as adding one gram of brisket to your plate), but meat rice can still supplement meals in food-insecure areas, the researchers say. Growing cultured beef is also better for the environment than raising cattle.

Google will cross-reference the satellite’s methane detection with the locations of oil and gas infrastructure to determine the types of equipment that leak the greenhouse gas. The data will be available later this year on the Google Earth Engine platform, which is free to researchers, nonprofits, and news media.

In the 19th century, Luddites smashed up automatic looms to protest the new technology. Last weekend, people at a San Francisco Lunar New Year celebration seemed to have the same idea—but with more firepower. A mob [incinerated](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hpK?mblid=d7f215b22c00&mbcid=34377952.3914737&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) an autonomous vehicle (AV) operated by Alphabet subsidiary Waymo after it rolled into a crowded intersection.

After one person jumped on the hood and smashed the windshield of the driverless—and passengerless—Jaguar I-PACE crossover, others began breaking windows and spray-painting the body. The car was eventually [set ablaze](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hpL?mblid=a68d42639b87&mbcid=34377952.3914737&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) with fireworks.

Though the mob’s motivation is unknown, the attack felt like a comeuppance: Over the past few years, SF has been a major testing hub for AVs, along with Phoenix and Austin. The hundreds of driverless taxis zipping around the city’s hills annoy residents almost as much as out-of-towners who call it San Fran. AVs have been filmed causing traffic jams and [blocking](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hpM?mblid=22618f0658d0&mbcid=34377952.3914737&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) emergency vehicles on numerous occasions. One has even been at the center of a very serious accident.

The roadblocks have cast doubt on the near-term prospect of a future where getting chauffeured around by AI is mainstream. So, buckle in while we explore the state of the AV industry and what it might take to stop it from inspiring rage.

## Industry stuck in a rut

One major setback for a driverless future came in October, when a Cruise AV, operated by GM, struck a woman who was thrown into its path after getting hit by a human driver in San Francisco. Instead of stopping immediately, the Cruise AV dragged the pedestrian 20 feet as it tried to pull over to the side of the road. The woman sustained serious injuries.

California and federal officials are investigating the company, which has been in crisis ever since an investigation by an outside law firm that Cruise hired found that the incident was the result of multiple technical failures. Cruise admitted that it improperly failed to disclose all the details to regulators. The company recalled its entire fleet of 950 AVs, paused all testing countrywide, and sacked top executives. California’s DMV has suspended Cruise’s permit to test AVs on public roads.

But it’s not just about Cruise:

* Waymo recalled 444 self-driving cars this week after two of its AVs in Arizona bumped the same towed vehicle minutes apart.
* A handful of Chinese companies, including Didi, have recently stopped testing their AVs in California. While friction between the US and China could be to blame, George Washington University Engineering professor John Helveston told Business Insider that Didi’s exit might have to do with the harsher regulatory environment following the Cruise accident.

Experts say that the biggest issues with current AVs occur when they run into unusual situations that might be a no-brainer for a person. It’s likely a human driver would’ve stopped the car to check on a pedestrian they just hit before trying to pull over, while many SF Uber drivers would’ve probably used common sense and avoided the chaos of the Lunar New Year festivities.

## Is it just an image problem?

The industry’s problems are its own doing, according to the Verge’s transportation editor, Andrew J. Hawkins. He blames the current loss of public trust on [years of overpromising](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hpO?mblid=c33ef4d417d2&mbcid=34377952.3914737&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) by some industry executives ([ahem](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hpP?mblid=3f601f193312&mbcid=34377952.3914737&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), Elon) that we’ll all be cruising around in the backseat while our cars drive themselves in the near future. Hawkins believes a lack of regulation allowed some companies to rush into testing AVs, which ultimately undermined the public’s confidence in the tech.

Meanwhile, some say we should remember that while the spate of high-profile AV fails is disconcerting, humans behind the wheel can spell even more trouble—especially since they’re not always attentive or sober. Ars Technica reporter Timothy B. Lee, who analyzed Cruise and Waymo crash reports, claims that Waymo AVs [already appear safer](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hpQ?mblid=a6124c77695a&mbcid=34377952.3914737&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) than human drivers, though he says more research is needed.

While Lee notes that both companies’ driverless cars sometimes struggle to avoid hitting inanimate objects and Cruise’s AVs need to be better at navigating intersections, they’ve mostly been involved in minor accidents. He argues that given AVs’ potential to become “much safer” than human drivers, ending testing on city streets “could easily cost more lives than it saves.”

But the public’s perception of AVs doesn’t always match the cars’ safety record: A study published in _Transportation Research_ in 2021 found that autonomous vehicles will have to be [much less likely](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hpR?mblid=a3c9fa2f37ae&mbcid=34377952.3914737&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), “potentially unrealistically,” to crash than human drivers for passengers to trust them.

**Most people probably have time to get used to the idea…**a [recent report](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hpS?mblid=832ac0de7b86&mbcid=34377952.3914737&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) by S&P Global Mobility predicts that a car “that can go anywhere and do everything a human driver can” will not arrive before at least 2035, while in the meantime, AVs will only be operated in designated areas or as an aid for human drivers._—SK_

_It’s a big world out there. In this section, we’ll teleport you to an interesting location—and hopefully give you travel ideas in the process._

There’s no hotel more relevant during Presidents Day weekend than the Beekman Arms, the self-proclaimed oldest inn in the US, famous for providing shelter to real American presidents (George Washington, Bill Clinton) and actors who have portrayed them in film and TV (Jack Nicholson, Beau Bridges).

“The Beek,” as locals call it, opened in 1766 in New York’s Hudson Valley and has counted many presidents and would-be presidents among its list of [famous guests](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hp-?mblid=3facfc155fc5&mbcid=34377952.3914737&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) over the years.

* Franklin D. Roosevelt wrapped up his campaigns for governor and president with speeches on the inn’s front porch.
* George Washington really did sleep there. During the Revolutionary War, he stayed at the Beek along with Philip Schuyler, Benedict Arnold, and Alexander Hamilton.
* Bill Clinton and Benjamin Harrison have also been there, along with VPs Al Gore, Aaron Burr, Levi Morton, and Nelson Rockefeller.

**You can leave with some history, too.** If stealing towels from the room isn’t your thing, the hotel’s antique market is located in a two-story barn behind the building and hosts about 30 dealers ready to sell you some historic knickknacks. There are vintage paintings, books, and furniture for people who want to take home something more interesting than the hotel shampoo bottles._—DL_

## [Crowd work](#) 

Last week, we asked you to share the worst gift you’ve ever received on Valentine’s Day. Here are our favorite answers:

* “Senior year in college, my then-boyfriend gave me candy and flowers. When it was delivered, he didn’t have enough money to cover the cost and I paid for my ‘gift.’”—_Erin from Boston, MA_
* “I had only been dating this guy for a few weeks and he gave me an expensive ENGAGEMENT RING on Valentine’s Day. He said he wasn’t proposing but wanted me to wear it and pretend we were engaged. We broke up shortly after that incident.”—_Jen from Pennsylvania_
* “My boyfriend gave me a gift certificate to see his dentist for teeth whitening and a dental exam.”—_Heather from Provo, Utah_
* “My husband bought me an ax. It was a nice one, but I suggested in the future I’d prefer not to get weapons for Valentine’s Day.”—_Amy from Midlothian, VA_

**✳︎ A Note From Facet**

_\*Source: [https://www.finder.com/unused-gym-memberships](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aku?mblid=0d833d528a9a&mbcid=34377952.3914737&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)_

_\*\*Facet Wealth, Inc. (“Facet”) is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities. This is not investment, financial, legal, or tax advice. Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023\. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year. Offer ends February 29, 2024._
