**Good morning.** Feel like you’ve been seeing a lot of Travis Kelce lately, even when he’s not playing football?

You’re not wrong: The Chiefs tight end/most famous boyfriend in the world has hawked products in [more commercials](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fp7?mblid=510a537723fa&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) during NFL games so far this season than any other celeb, with 375 ad appearances, according to iSpot. Kelce’s teammate Patrick Mahomes was in second place (341), followed by Kevin Miles, aka Jake from State Farm (247).

Before you ask, these deals were locked in before he started dating Taylor Swift, but advertisers ramped up Kelce’s exposure knowing they had marketing gold on their hands.

## [ Facing antitrust snags, Adobe and Figma call it quits ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fp9?mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) 

[ ![Adobe and Figma logos tear in half](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,snPrG-hzyUvzPGh84IK-08U8fU_n6SMFRzFQH_VvXAOE/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/a6a569b1e8c6c2078b67dff226720df40d651384-1500x1000.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fp9?mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) _Francis Scialabba_ 

The next time you’re feeling sad about a breakup, just be glad you don’t have to pay a fee for ending the relationship—like Adobe.

The software giant’s planned $20 billion acquisition of the design tool Figma officially [fell apart yesterday](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpa?mblid=6b58fa5bdaa6&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) amid mounting pressure from competition regulators, putting the kibosh on what would have been one of the largest private software takeovers in history. While the two companies mutually decided to cancel their deal, Adobe now has to pay its almost-subsidiary a $1 billion cash termination fee.

**Rewind:** In September 2022, Adobe [agreed to buy](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpb?mblid=336c4bf2d580&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) Figma—a [fast-growing rival](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpc?mblid=91f6f8d4db49&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to some of Adobe’s tools that’s used by Big Tech firms, including Uber, Zoom, and Google—for roughly double its value.

Since then, EU and UK antitrust [investigators said](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpd?mblid=504e203dc9bb&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that the acquisition would harm customers and stifle innovation in product-design software by eliminating competition between two leaders in the space. Regulators suggested the software companies sell off competing products to save the deal, but the CEO of Figma [said](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpe?mblid=af3b62fab8e7&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) his company and Adobe “no longer see a path toward regulatory approval.”

## It’s a tough time to be in Mergers & Acquisitions

The Adobe x Figma breakup is one of _many_ recent acquisition attempts that have landed in the regulation hot seat in what appears to be an era of heightened antitrust enforcement in both the US and Europe, especially in tech:

* Meta finally sold off Giphy in May after UK regulators [blocked the acquisition](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpf?mblid=5b4a1330e17b&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) two years ago.
* On Sunday, the American biotech company Illumina agreed to sell off its cancer diagnostic test-maker, Grail, after losing a court battle with the Federal Trade Commission (which is challenging mergers at a [record pace](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpg?mblid=2931c510f22b&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) under Biden).

**Zoom out:** Some analysts worry that antitrust crackdowns will dampen opportunities for dealmaking, but for now, the sun is still shining—companies announced [more than $40 billion in proposed M&As](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fph?mblid=1dba94556fb0&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) yesterday, more than quadruple the value announced on the last Monday before Christmas in 2022.—_ML_

Morgan and Andrew Carnegie among its founders, has [agreed to be bought](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpl?mblid=e57a268fb757&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) by Japan’s Nippon Steel. The deal ends months of speculation over the 122-year-old steel company’s fate after it rebuffed a $7.3 billion offer from domestic rival Cleveland-Cliffs over the summer. Assuming regulators and US Steel’s shareholders sign off on the purchase, it would make Nippon the second-biggest steel company globally and give it a major presence in the US market, which uses a lot of steel, especially to make cars.

While that’s less than the Elizabeth Holmes-level, 11-year sentence prosecutors had pushed for, it’s more than the probation he requested. Nikola was briefly the third-most-valuable vehicle company in the US, but its value plunged when a short seller accused the company of lying about its tech. Prosecutors agreed and [claimed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpn?mblid=5bdc322ec7ab&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) Milton fibbed about the company’s progress, including in an infamous video that purported to show one of its trucks operational and moving when it was really just rolled down a hill.

Although the church did not change its position on marriage, the new guidelines do effectively overturn a 2021 decision that prohibited any blessings for gay couples. It’s the latest sign of Pope Francis softening the church’s stance toward LGBTQ people, which has drawn backlash from more conservative clergy.

British Petroleum became the latest company to pause shipping via the Red Sea yesterday, citing the violent threat of Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. At least nine other carriers, including the Danish cargo giant Maersk, have recently said they’ll temporarily steer clear of the treacherous waters.

The Houthi militants have been attacking commercial vessels passing through the southern part of the sea ever since the Israel–Hamas war erupted in October. It’s creating a [global issue](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpq?mblid=078221131be5&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a): The Red Sea flows into the Suez Canal, the fastest maritime link between Europe and Asia, which about 12% of world trade passes through.

## Danger vs. efficiency

Many shipping companies have decided to [sacrifice speed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpr?mblid=99249002ec44&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for safety by sailing around the southern tip of Africa instead.

While Houthi attacks have already [made](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fps?mblid=d7ecef701c2e&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) moving cargo pricier, maritime journalist John Konrad [pointed out](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpt?mblid=62aa9ad0e38c&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that rerouting energy shipments is likely to cause even bigger headaches since there are fewer spare oil tankers than container ships, and they don’t have the ability to win back significant ETA by speeding up.

Though most oil carriers aren’t rerouting, oil futures prices went up 1.6% yesterday, along with a rise in the cost of insuring ships against the perils of Red Sea voyages.

**Ships will soon get more bodyguards:** The US, multiple European countries, Bahrain, and several others have agreed to vastly expand the international naval force that already patrols the Red Sea. The US also moved the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier near Yemen’s coast as it reportedly considers launching a strike at Houthi positions._—SK_

Apple announced it would preemptively pull the watches from its online store on Thursday and physical locations on Dec. 24 to comply with an order from the International Trade Commission (ITC) barring the import of the watch models after it found them to violate Masimo’s IP.

While the outlook is bleak, Apple can still hope for a Christmas miracle.

* The Biden administration has until Dec. 25 to overturn the ITC ruling. But history shows that’s unlikely; the last time a president vetoed an ITC decision was in 2013, when Barack Obama overturned an Apple import ban from a patent dispute with Samsung.

**Another hit to the bottom line:** Apple, already coming off four straight quarters of declining sales for the first time since 2001, cautioned investors in November that holiday sales were expected to be sluggish and specifically cited an expected drop in sales from its wearables category. Still, Apple is working on possible technical and legal [workarounds](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpU?mblid=35932b5651a3&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to protect its $17 billion watch business, according to Bloomberg._—DL_

**Stat:** Is gearing up for holiday travel giving you unpleasant flashbacks to last year when Southwest canceled almost 17,000 flights, leaving more than 2 million people stuck (some at their in-laws’ house!)? You haven’t been forgotten—the Department of Transportation just slapped Southwest with its largest consumer protection [fine](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpC?mblid=73b7b9eae361&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) ever over the meltdown. The fine is $140 million, with $35 million going to the government and the rest covering perks that went to passengers affected by the 2022 snafu or for travelers facing future delays and cancellations. And the DOT means business: The Southwest penalty is \~30x the next largest fine an airline has paid for such violations.

**Quote:** “Blue Origin needs to be much faster.”

Jeff Bezos said that in a [recent interview](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpD?mblid=bea59fbf5141&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), but the former CEO didn’t get his wish, because yesterday, Blue Origin had to [scrub](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpE?mblid=86110febae88&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) its first planned rocket launch in more than 15 months at the last moment due to what it described as “a ground system issue.” Even after it gets its rocket off the ground again, Blue Origin has some catching up to do: The company employs the same number of people as Elon Musk’s SpaceX (11,000), but it has launched zero rockets this year, while SpaceX [has sent](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpF?mblid=be950040e37c&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) almost 100 rockets and thousands of satellites into space over the same period, per Ars Technica.

**Read:** All the articles Bloomberg’s editors wish they had written this year. ([Bloomberg](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fpG?mblid=7a97d2eaa44a&mbcid=33738382.3554285&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a))
