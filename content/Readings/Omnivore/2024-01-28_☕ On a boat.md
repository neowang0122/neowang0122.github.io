**Good morning.** Tomorrow, the NFL will play two conference championship games that will determine the Super Bowl matchup. Don’t have a horse in the race and unsure who to root for? Here’s a cheat sheet.

* **If you love an underdog story and Eminem:** Detroit
* **If you live in the Bay Area:** 49ers
* **If you’re tired of hearing about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift:** Ravens
* **If you’re the NFL:** Chiefs

### TRAVEL

## [ This is the biggest thing in cruising ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCq?mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) 

[ ![Royal Caribbean Icon of the Seas cruise ship](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,s8xAW9MmGWv7smnUE5myRSyhASITheruN_X4SAR-tDpk/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/8ae13a6f7664965192c29a0545455cdad32f52f1-1500x1000.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCq?mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) _Royal Caribbean_ 

When the world’s largest cruise ship sets off on its maiden voyage from the 305 to the Caribbean this evening, thousands of passengers—and everyone with a social media feed—will finally see if the Icon of the Seas lives up to its name.

Five times heavier than the Titanic, Royal Caribbean’s new behemoth turned heads after its initial [unveiling](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9f9?mblid=a4acd9a545b4&mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) last summer: The 20-deck, \~1,200-foot-long ship has 40 restaurants, seven pools, eight “neighborhoods,” and unconventional [amenities](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCr?mblid=7b87582d2c47&mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) like an escape room and a carousel. No wonder most of its inaugural seven-day trip will be spent at sea, with only three half-day stops along the way.

**Pop the bubbly.** This week, Royal Caribbean became the main Inter Miami jersey sponsor, and team captain Lionel Messi rang in the partnership by christening the Icon of the Seas in Florida fashion: pressing a soccer ball to a button that sent a bottle of [champagne ziplining](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCs?mblid=dbaff7c392e4&mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) into the ship’s bow.

## Cruises are crushing right now

The ceremony was fitting for an industry that’s celebrating an [explosive comeback](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCt?mblid=d50d0ba7c531&mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). Now that passenger ships have recovered from their Covid-era cesspool image, cruise line bookings are surpassing pre-pandemic levels.

* Bookings in November 2023 for 2024 cruises were about 20% higher than bookings in November 2019 for 2020 cruises, one analyst told [Reuters](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCu?mblid=08563ba30534&mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).
* Royal Caribbean has rebounded especially well, roughly quadrupling its stock price from a pandemic low and recording its “single largest booking day” ever when reservations opened for Icon of the Seas in October 2022.

Repeat customers and youngins are boosting business for the cruise industry.

* Eighty-five percent of cruise passengers say they’d go again, according to the Cruise Lines International Association.
* More than two-thirds of 18- to 24-year-olds are at least somewhat interested in taking a cruise, per the analytics platform CivicScience.

And even watching cruises is popular—on TikTok, posts about Royal Caribbean’s [nine-month cruise](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCv?mblid=29f9759f0005&mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) have more than 350 million views.

**It comes at a price.** Cruise ship emissions are [up 6%](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCw?mblid=5dc8c3233e62&mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) from before the pandemic, according to the Climate TRACE coalition._—ML_

Last May, a different federal jury found Trump liable for defamation and sexual abuse and awarded her $5 million (Trump is appealing). Because of that, the jury in this second trial was only called upon to decide what damages Carroll should receive. Trump called the verdict “absolutely ridiculous,” and his lawyer said they would lodge an appeal of the new verdict “immediately.”

Uncle Sam is shelving plans to ship more natural gas abroad. The Biden administration announced yesterday that it would [temporarily halt](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCB?mblid=24310175237b&mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) approving new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects.

The pause will not affect existing exports or already permitted projects, but it’ll give the Energy Department some time to study how LNG exports affect climate change, national security, the local environment, and energy prices in the US before signing off on more.

Biden’s move is seen as an election-season “I gotchu” to environmental activists unhappy with his [approval](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCC?mblid=b3f41dd8e618&mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of a massive oil drilling project on federal lands in Alaska.

## Gas boom times

The US didn’t export LNG before 2016, but the expansion of fracking during the 2010s quickly made it a top exporter…

* Export capacity has tripled since 2018, per the US Energy Information Administration, and it’s projected to almost double again by 2030.
* European countries have relied on American LNG as they ditch Russian imports amid the war in Ukraine, while some Asian nations use it as a (somewhat) cleaner alternative to coal.

The gas and oil industry predictably lashed out at the decision to pause approvals, as multiple not-yet-permitted projects along the Gulf Coast—the heart of the LNG export industry—are now up in the air.

**But it probably won’t create gas shortages…**since ongoing projects are enough to [satisfy demand](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCD?mblid=b2e82a4e03b3&mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), analysts predict.

The first mention of loud budgeting came in a TikTok from New York-based comedian Lukas Battle in December, where he compares it to sneaking candy into a movie theater, saying, “It’s not ‘I don’t have enough,’ it’s, ‘I don’t want to spend.’” Since then, the video has amassed more than 1.4 million views, and creators in the personal finance sphere have glommed onto the idea, encouraging people to set budgets and get their social circle involved for accountability. Tips include…

* Asking your friends to trade expensive dinners or trips for potlucks or free activities.
* Being upfront about not being able to do something because it’s out of your budget for the month.

**Why now?** It’s the start of 2024, and everyone is reflecting and setting goals.

**Stat:** It’s time for another entry into the genre of [surprisingly poignant](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCO?mblid=dec6611db6e7&mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) retirements for NASA’s equipment on Mars. This week, Ingenuity, NASA’s little helicopter that could, just [couldn’t](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCP?mblid=86af610ad6bf&mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) anymore: After 72 flights in its three years on Mars, the copter’s $85 million mission was declared finished because of damage to its rotor blades. But even though its flying days are over, Ingenuity went out an overachiever.

**Quote:** “Actions that may feel sudden to some may seem long overdue to others.”

New York City’s American Museum of Natural History, which gets 4.5 million visitors annually to see the squid and the whale, [closed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCQ?mblid=924b62ac4b2b&mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) two galleries as museums around the country work to comply with new federal regulations requiring them to get consent from tribes before displaying Native American objects. The museum’s president, Sean Decatur, told staff the two exhibits, which focus on the Eastern Woodlands and the Great Plains, were “artifacts of an era” when museums did not respect Indigenous peoples’ values and perspectives. He said some objects might go back on display, while others may not.

**Read:** Social media is obsessed with movies and might just save them—if it doesn’t kill them first. ([The Hollywood Reporter](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gCR?mblid=94b992fd48e7&mbcid=34142981.78195&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a))
