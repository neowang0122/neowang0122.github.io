My Finder sidebar won't show Home, Desktop, Applications, All My Files -- even though they are checked in Finder Preferences.

I tried three suggestions I spotted in the forums, but didn't fix: 

1\. Disk utility repairs

2\. Deleting 'com.apple.sidebarlists.plist' (file not in Library)

3\. View - show sidebar.

I have MBA, 1.6GHz, 4GB, v10.7.4

Any suggestions?

Hi Michael, 

I had the same problem and solved it a very easy way. Infact I felt pretty silly. Haha hopefully this solves your problem too. 

Close all finder windows so when you click the finder icon it opens a new finder window, one with no sidebar. Then ==go View====&gt;====Show Toolbar== 

Then once the toolbar is enabled, the view/hide sidebar toggle becomes activated in that same menu. 

Good Luck! Let me know if that fixed it. 

How do I restore missing Finder sidebar?
