**Good morning and happy Lunar New Year** to everyone celebrating the spring festival. Today we say goodbye to the Year of the Rabbit and hello to the Year of the Dragon—or Wood Dragon if you want to get specific.

People born in the Year of the Dragon are said to embody a host of desirable traits, including being strong leaders, energetic, and charismatic. It’s the most auspicious year of any in the 12-year Chinese cycle, and therefore typically sees the highest number of births.

There’s a lot more riding on this year’s Super Bowl than the success of your buffalo chicken dip. [68 million](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8j?mblid=dc0c3a7e8a1c&mbcid=34303345.3390828&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) US adults will be betting on this Sunday’s game, according to the American Gaming Association.

The trade group expects 35% more gamblers than last year and a record $23.1 billion worth of bets (up from $16 billion last year). And one analyst says we should prepare for the next ten years of Super Bowls to keep setting records.

The surge in wagers reflects a cultural shift that includes the NFL finally embracing gambling by its fans—in the industry’s hometown of Las Vegas, no less.

## Why did the NFL change its tune on sports betting?

The short answer: money.

The NFL tried to [distance](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8k?mblid=203a4b0ce004&mbcid=34303345.3390828&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) itself from gambling for years, fearing for its credibility. The league even joined other sports organizations in 1992 to lobby for tighter sports gambling rules in the US.

**But…**when the Supreme Court opened the floodgates for [legal sports betting](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8X?mblid=0c14b7d5c285&mbcid=34303345.3390828&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in 2018, the league could only resist the stacks of cash on the table for so long. In 2021, the NFL said it was entering a deal with betting companies like DraftKings, FanDuel, and Caesars that would pay the league nearly $1 billion through 2026.

**The league even did a 180 on Vegas.** This year’s Super Bowl location would have had NFL commissioners of the past aghast. In 2003, the NFL famously refused a Las Vegas ad for that year’s Super Bowl with the slogan “What Happens Here, Stays Here” because it claimed the ad promoted gambling.

It’s still come down hard on its own players for gambling, though. Just last year, 10 players were suspended for breaking NFL betting policy. Gambling addiction experts also aren’t all in, as they worry about the ease of putting money on the game.

**Not all the action will be in Vegas...**If you want to bet on what will happen on the field, you can do it at a casino on the strip. But if you’re more interested in putting money on whether Taylor Swift will [cry](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8l?mblid=07d9d4a31e09&mbcid=34303345.3390828&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) if the Chiefs lose or any other novelty bet, they can’t legally help you, and you’ll have to do it online or between bites of 7-layer dip._—MM_

Sam Altman is really craving chips, but not the kind you’re stocking up on for the Super Bowl. As his company, OpenAI, hungers for semiconductors to power its AI models, Altman has been [trying to raise](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8u?mblid=d3670478ada8&mbcid=34303345.3390828&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) as much as $7 trillion to expand global production capacity, WSJ reported this week.

Yes, we’re talking trillions—a herculean ambition given that just $527 billion worth of chips were sold globally last year. OpenAI has struggled to secure sufficient supply from chip designer Nvidia, which sells much of the microprocessors fueling the ongoing AI frenzy.

## Seeking a helping hand

Altman wants to create OpenAI’s very own semiconductor supplier, but he can’t do it alone…

* The entrepreneur has reportedly tried to convince Silicon Valley VCs, government-affiliated investors in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as the sharks at SoftBank to bankroll the venture.
* He’s also talking to chip behemoth Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company about establishing production facilities worldwide.

WaPo says he’s also been in contact with US lawmakers to discuss where to best build chip factories. Microprocessor availability has also been a major priority for Uncle Sam.

**Zoom out:** Microsoft and Alphabet are designing their own chips, while legacy chipmakers like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices vie to challenge Nvidia’s dominance in the AI space._—SK_

![The cover of British Vogue](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,s3ZQ0S3bqVLg7DT-Js2gdJ8_kt6taJPXczCwWv4bS6s4/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/feef642bd311c973dee9e19d70aaa4ff7965c930-1500x1000.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) _British Vogue via Instagram_ 

**Quote:** “I said what I wanted to say.”

British Vogue’s editor in chief, Edward Enninful, just wrapped his [final issue](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8I?mblid=a9a8952c5f85&mbcid=34303345.3390828&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) at the magazine (he’s moving on to an advisory role at its publisher, Condé Nast), and true to form, he did it in style. Not content with putting just one huge star on his last cover, Enninful—the first man and first Black person at the top of the legendary fashion magazine’s masthead—[assembled 40](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8J?mblid=d20c2f1264c2&mbcid=34303345.3390828&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). The image reflected a [real moment](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8K?mblid=f60bd8fdb433&mbcid=34303345.3390828&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), not a trick of photoshop: Celebrities from Oprah to mother-daughter duo Cindy Crawford and Kaia Gerber to Jane Fonda all gathered in one spot to pose together for Enninful’s swan song.

**Stat:** Planning on getting your hands greasy with some wings during the big game tomorrow? You’re in good company: The National Chicken Council [anticipates](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8L?mblid=33e88bf273d7&mbcid=34303345.3390828&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that almost 1.5 billion wings will be consumed across the US. That’s enough for every person in the country to have four, per Axios. And of course the real Super Bowl contest won’t be between Taylor Swift’s boyfriend and the other team, it’ll be between the bone-in and boneless tribes. Buffalo Wild Wings, which typically serves up 11 million wings during the game, said bone-in (the kind that is actually a chicken’s wing) claimed the ring last year.

**Read:** The jobs that skew heavily toward one gender or race—in charts. ([Wall Street Journal](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h8M?mblid=65add25743b4&mbcid=34303345.3390828&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a))
