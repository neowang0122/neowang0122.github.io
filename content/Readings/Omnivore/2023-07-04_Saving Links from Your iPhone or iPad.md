# Full Content: 

With the [Omnivore app for iOS](https://omnivore.app/install/ios), it’s easy to save web pages and articles or archive web content to read later. 

The Omnivore app uses the _iOS Share System_, which lets you send items from one app (such as Safari) to another (such as Messages or Mail). 

* Step 1: Log in to the Omnivore app.
* Step 2: Add Omnivore to your Share menu favorites.
* Step 3: Save links to your Omnivore Library.

 You must be logged in before you can save links via the Share menu. If you don’t already have an Omnivore account, you can sign up for free from the login screen. 

_Note:_ If you haven’t installed the iOS app, download it here: <https://omnivore.app/install/ios> 

## **Step 2: Add Omnivore to your Share menu favorites.** 

 Start by viewing the Share menu from within any supported iOS app (we’ve used Safari for this example). 

1. Tap the **Share** icon at the bottom of the screen.
2. Swipe left to the end of the list of app icons and tap **More**.
3. Tap **Edit** at the top of the screen.
4. Scroll down until you see the **Omnivore** icon and tap the **+** icon next to it.
5. Press and hold the three-bar icon and drag Omnivore to one of the top positions under Favorites. Tap **Done** to close the menu.
6. **Omnivore** will appear as one of the first options the next time you use the Share feature (you may need to restart Safari).

## **Step 3: Save links to your Omnivore Library** 

Start by navigating to the page or article you wish to save. Please note that Omnivore will save the content that appears on your screen (not just a link), so _if the page is behind a paywall and you are logged into the paywalled site, you will save the paid content._ 

1. While viewing the page you’d like to save, tap the **Share** icon.
2. Tap the **Omnivore** icon in the Share menu.
3. Tag the article with one or more labels (optional) and tap **Read Now** or **Read Later**.
4. If you choose Read Later, the link will appear in your Library the next time you open the Omnivore app.
