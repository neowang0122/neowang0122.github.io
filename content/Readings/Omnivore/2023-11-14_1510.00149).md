## Highlights

> computationally intensive and memory intensive [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/1510-18bcfc6fefa#ca1584a3-68ee-476f-a5ca-a60b227a1048)  ^ca1584a3

> difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/1510-18bcfc6fefa#25e8ad93-14db-40ae-b335-bb667136f040)  ^25e8ad93

> “deep compression”, a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/1510-18bcfc6fefa#fd3e1cde-f9cb-49be-94f1-90a5a69bb416)  ^fd3e1cde

> Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/1510-18bcfc6fefa#1a25e926-0824-40ed-a38f-7aab38d1d5ee)  ^1a25e926
