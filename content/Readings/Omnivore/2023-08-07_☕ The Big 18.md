**Good morning.** It boggles the mind of a Northeasterner who’s used to a post-Labor Day start, but apparently many kids across the US will return for the first day of school this morning.

Of course, they’ll have an earlier start to the summer than we did. So here’s a question: Would you rather be in school for most of August but out by Memorial Day? Or have August free but sit in class through June ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/18x0,sIPsaqWLK5hGdBZEa43ReQgvlSHDtvrtzyPuNGKpxA2E/https://em-content.zobj.net/thumbs/120/apple/237/thinking-face_1f914.png)?

* **Markets:** Here’s hoping this week will be better than the last one for the stock market, when the S&P 500 and Nasdaq logged their [worst week](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/al6?mblid=26da13d36fb8&mbcid=32314390.123850&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) since March. But, if you’ll oblige us, turn your gaze away from stocks and toward _bonds_ and you’ll discover something more interesting: Yields on the 10-year Treasury note have [jumped](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alR?mblid=e2cd1d865499&mbcid=32314390.123850&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to nearly their highest level in 10+ years. This indicates that investors are betting that elevated interest rates will stick around for a while (bad for anyone looking to buy a house, but a good sign for healthy economic growth).

Over the past few days, college football has undergone a shake-up that further obliterated traditional geographic rivalries, left a once-proud conference on its deathbed, and cemented the formation of a handful of national superconferences—all in the [pursuit of TV riches](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alT?mblid=3193b1c779ba&mbcid=32314390.123850&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

The moves reflect the inevitable professionalization of college football, one of the only university athletic products that can command billions of dollars for television broadcast rights.

**Here’s what went down:**

* Oregon and Washington [defected](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alU?mblid=97b1055b7978&mbcid=32314390.123850&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) from the Pac-12 for the Big Ten, joining their West Coast peers USC and UCLA in the once-Midwestern-focused conference that will soon have 18 teams from coast to coast.
* Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah said they would also leave the Pac-12 for the Big 12, a decision Colorado made two weeks ago.
* The 108-year-old Pac-12 is teetering on the verge of collapse with just four schools remaining: Stanford, Cal, Oregon State, and Washington State.

## If you hate this, blame TV

The Big Ten and Southeastern Conference (SEC) have recently secured mega TV deals that will pay their members handsomely…and the Pac-12 has not. It’s that simple.

The SEC inked a $3 billion deal for 10 years with Disney beginning in 2024, while the Big Ten reached a mammoth agreement with Fox, CBS, and NBC worth up to $7.5 billion over seven years. The Pac-12 has been trying to strike a deal with Apple TV+ to stream its games, but the potential payout for schools was not enough to stop the exodus.

* The Big Ten sent $58 million to each of its schools during the 2021–22 fiscal year, according to tax records, and that number will only grow under its new TV deal.
* Under the Apple deal, Pac-12 members would receive $30 million…on the high end of the range.

**Big picture:** “The old question—how long would it take TV money to destroy college football? Maybe we’re here. Maybe we’re here,” the head football coach at Washington State mused last Thursday. And whether or not you agree that conference realignment has “destroyed” college football, it has certainly dismantled the regional distinctiveness of each conference that gave the sport its magic.

Coming ahead of the quarterfinal round, it was the US women’s earliest exit from a World Cup ever. The next chance for some hardware isn’t far away—the Paris Olympics are next summer—but the once-dominant USWNT has found that its international peers are catching up to its quality.

RIP fully remote work: 2020–2023\. You lived a beautiful life that left an imprint on couches everywhere.

The cause of death? Videoconferencing software company Zoom has told employees within a 50-mile radius of one of its offices that they [must come in](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/am1?mblid=48b26b51f92d&mbcid=32314390.123850&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) at least two days a week, Insider reported.

Zoom, of course, was the poster child for remote work during the pandemic, emerging from obscurity to become the go-to video platform for work meetings and awkward virtual happy hours. So, I don’t need to explain the symbolism of Zoom telling its employees to return to the physical office to describe how CEOs think fully remote work is going for them.

The increased hostility toward WFH from executives certainly hasn’t been good for Zoom stock. After soaring more than 6x during the pandemic, Zoom has lost more than $100 billion in market value since its peak, per Insider.

## Google’s trying a different strategy to lure workers back

A cheap hotel stay. The tech giant is offering its employees a sweetheart deal to check in to the [Google-owned hotel](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/am2?mblid=0f2f70059378&mbcid=32314390.123850&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) on its Mountain View campus for $99 a night, CNBC reported, hoping that a breezy commute will attract more Googlers to code in person.

This “Summer Special” does not fall under approved business travel, so the hotel stays will come out of employees’ pockets. Still, workers have been doing the math…and $99/night comes out to about $3,000/month, which is less than many of them pay for rent in Silicon Valley. Plus, someone makes your bed.

Across the country, the share of car buyers who financed a vehicle with a monthly payment of at least $1,000 jumped to a record 17.1% in Q2 (in 2019, it was just 4.3%). Higher auto prices and borrowing rates are making buying a vehicle a major expense for households.

**✢ A Note From Facet**

_\*\*Facet Wealth, Inc. (“Facet”) is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. This is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to purchase securities. This is not investment, financial, legal, or tax advice. Based on a study conducted by Facet in April 2023\. A statistically valid sample of members following Facet’s current planning process demonstrated that more than half of these members, defined here as a majority, achieved value greater than their planning fee. This value was shown to reoccur on an annual basis. Assumptions included average expenses and fees, using retirement tax savings, portfolio expenses and tax loss harvesting as value drivers using Facet’s investment services, and discounting value to align with the acceptance of Facet recommendations. Facet assesses clients an annual flat fee for service based on the complexity of planning needs. There is no separate or additional fee for investment management. This is not a guarantee or prediction of actual results for any member and results may vary by member. Some value like tax loss harvesting may vary year to year. Offer ends August 31, 2023._
