**Good morning.** We’re lifting the wraps on a new project to make reading the Brew even more fun. Give a warm welcome to Word of the Day.

Here’s how it works: You, the readers, will submit funny, unique words you want to see in the newsletter (think: moist, whippersnapper, circumjacent, etc.), and it’ll be our responsibility to include one of these words somewhere in the Brew each day. While reading, you can guess what the Word of the Day is and we’ll reveal it in the Answer section.

But this requires your participation: After reading the newsletter, scroll back up and [submit your word here](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVn?mblid=d356f94d6904&mbcid=32457734.3791294&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for Word of the Day. We’ll kick off a test run tomorrow.

* **Markets:** Investors are frazzled following the S&P 500’s third consecutive weekly slide—its worst stretch since February. But there’s no rest for the weary. The upcoming week contains [two events](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVo?mblid=a7ce4b0a7f8d&mbcid=32457734.3791294&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) with major market-moving potential: AI leader Nvidia’s earnings on Wednesday, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s annual speech at the Fed conference in Jackson Hole on Friday.

The moon’s south pole is littered with craters, can get colder than –300 degrees Fahrenheit, and hasn’t seen a lick of sunlight in billions of years.

It’s also the trendiest destination in the solar system.

This week, Russia and India were racing to become the first country to land a spacecraft on the lunar south pole, which, despite its hostile climate, could have significant commercial and geopolitical value for any Earthly power looking to extend its reach into space.

**It didn’t go well for Russia.** Yesterday, its Luna-25 spacecraft [crashed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVr?mblid=579e8970d521&mbcid=32457734.3791294&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) while attempting a moon landing, or as Russia’s dejected space agency put it, the vehicle “ceased to exist.” It’s a major setback for a country that was the first to land a spacecraft on the moon in 1966 but hadn’t launched a lunar mission in 47 years.

**India’s up next:** Its Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft has arrived in the neighborhood and will try to [touch down](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVs?mblid=82ac921ec126&mbcid=32457734.3791294&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) on Wednesday. If successful, it’d be a first for India and a credibility boost for its small-but-growing space program. India has set aside only $1.5 billion for its Department of Space, compared to NASA’s budget of \~$25 billion, per the WSJ.

## But why go to the dark side of the moon?

Because there’s ice. Ice, which melts and turns into water, could be pivotal for two reasons:

* It’s necessary for supporting human settlements in space, something NASA is trying to do with its Artemis missions in this decade.
* Water could also be used to make rocket fuel, establishing the moon as a literal launching pad for missions to deeper parts of the solar system, like Mars.

Using the moon’s natural resources to sustain human colonies and dial up future launches is key to unlocking the next generation of space exploration. Think about the $6 delivery fee for your Uber Eats order, and then consider the expense and time required to ship materials \~238,000 miles from the Earth to the moon.

“In-situ resource utilization,” which is the official term for exploiting the moon’s resources, is one area of the space industry where private sector companies see loads of opportunity. For example, Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin was just awarded a $35 million contract from NASA to develop solar cells out of lunar regolith, the crushed-up rock material that covers the entire lunar surface.

They’re making engines up to 80% smaller, 30% more fuel efficient, and 10x more powerful. And their engine platform can scale to meet various needs across markets like defense, aviation, drones, automotive, and more.

LiquidPiston engines are also capable of running on zero-carbon hydrogen fuel, which is timely since giants like Toyota and BMW have started moving toward hydrogen-powered cars.

In a little over a month since joining Inter Miami, Lionel Messi has far exceeded the lofty expectations set for him, boosting the fortunes of his team, Major League Soccer, and brands basking in the glow of his superstardom.

On Saturday night, Messi scored his[ tenth goal in seven games](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVB?mblid=24b277cf270a&mbcid=32457734.3791294&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), and his team, Inter Miami (which was really bad before he joined), won the Leagues Cup tournament in penalties. With his 44th trophy, Messi became the most decorated soccer player ever.

The secondary effects of Messi’s magnificent month have been astounding.

* **Apple:** Subscriptions to MLS Season Pass on Apple TV+ have more than doubled since Messi joined Inter Miami, one of the team owners tweeted. In a recent earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he “could not be happier with how the partnership is going.”
* **Jersey sales:** Messi’s now-iconic pink Inter Miami jersey was the [top seller](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVC?mblid=df317f9536e8&mbcid=32457734.3791294&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) across all sports for Fanatics last month, the WaPo reported, and an Adidas spokesperson told Reuters that demand for Messi’s jersey in Miami “has been truly unprecedented.”
* **Ticket prices:** Much like Swifties did for the Eras Tour, fans around the country have packed stadiums when Messi comes to town, sending [ticket prices skyrocketing](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVD?mblid=78e63c699616&mbcid=32457734.3791294&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) more than 1,700% on resale sites. In a game that sans Messi would have drawn a sparse crowd, last week’s Philadelphia vs. Inter Miami match had standing-room-only tickets going for $241 and field-level seats [for $16,200](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVC?mblid=9f1968c2ae95&mbcid=32457734.3791294&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).
* **Social media:** Inter Miami’s Instagram account has grown to over 14 million followers, more than any team in the NFL, NHL, or MLB.

**Bottom line:** There may be one person benefiting most from Messi’s dominant play—Messi himself. Due to his unique contract structure with Inter Miami, Messi gets a cut of the revenue he brings to Adidas and Apple.

**Stat:** Unlike Tom Wambsgans, other Americans aren’t snobby about their sushi. The grocery store operator Kroger is the [biggest purveyor of sushi](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aVJ?mblid=cf5fccd01fef&mbcid=32457734.3791294&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in the country, selling more than 40 million pieces per year, according to the WSJ. The company realized it was No.1 back in 2020 and in the past three years has ramped up its sushi offerings to claim even more market share (“When customers think of sushi, we want them to think of Kroger,” one exec said). But it’s not just Kroger—grocery stores across the US are benefiting from consumers choosing an $8.99 California roll over an omakase date night. Sushi sales at US retailers have risen more than 70% in the past year, per Circana.
