**Good morning.** Nebraska’s tourism slogan wasn’t for everyone; now it’s history. The state’s tourism director announced that its brutally honest tagline, “Nebraska, honestly it’s not for everyone,” would be retired after five years.

Is it the worst state tourism slogan ever? You decide. Here are some other contenders.

* **“Rhode Island: Cooler and Warmer.”** The state’s chief marketing officer was forced to resign over this in 2016.
* **Idaho’s license plates** have the slogan “Famous Potatoes.” If they’re that famous, you probably don’t need to remind everyone.
* **Washington** introduced “Say WA?” in 2006\. Residents said, “No.”

The best state slogan? “Virginia Is for Lovers.”

### REAL ESTATE

## [ Adam Neumann wants to buy back WeWork ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g-Y?mbcid=34260567.3476836&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)

He’s baaaaaack. Adam Neumann, the barefoot floptessa, wants to [buy](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g-Z?mblid=3d828c265c0e&mbcid=34260567.3476836&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the now-bankrupt WeWork, the company he founded and then was booted from five years ago. There’s just one thing in his way: WeWork.

A law firm representing Neumann and his new real estate company, Flow Global, sent a letter to WeWork Monday accusing its execs of refusing to take meetings to discuss a potential sale. Neumann has reportedly expressed interest in buying the company since December and has been trying to invest in it for even longer (including offering $1 billion in financing in October 2022, per the letter).

The letter also claimed Dan Loeb’s Third Point was interested in going in on the deal. But the hedge fund [told](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g--?mblid=39d11d81ed50&mbcid=34260567.3476836&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) CNBC it had made no commitments, and it’s only in preliminary talks with Flow.

WeWork responded that it gets a lot of offers from a lot of different groups, and it looks through all of them.

## Neumann wants to be Steve Jobs so bad

Like Jobs [returning](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g-%5F?mblid=3c0f29ac8afb&mbcid=34260567.3476836&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to run Apple after his firing, Neumann thinks he’s ready to get back on the horse. But there’s a lot of history:

* The former WeWork CEO threw lavish parties and led the company to big investments from SoftBank and a $47 billion valuation. At its height, WeWork was NYC’s largest corporate tenant.
* But Neumann saw everything rapidly crumble as soon as people started poking around the company’s financials and governance before its planned IPO—the company ousted him in 2019 and filed for bankruptcy last year.

There was a book, a Hulu series, and countless jokes in this very newsletter about the disaster.

**Neumann still wants to own where you work and live.** He has always wanted to “elevate the world’s consciousness” by jazzing up and renting out short-term rentals. He says the WeWork purchase would complement Flow’s residential real estate business, which got a $350 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz in 2022.

**Looking ahead…**WeWork might be saying no for now, but office landlords are knocking down its door for rent money. The company is currently trying to renegotiate and cancel roughly $3 billion worth of leases in bankruptcy court._—MM_

Imagine investing in real estate where the residents want it to succeed as much as you do.

Introducing [Roots](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g-k?lp=text1&mbadid=447270bef4c81ea16c522d75ade996fa&mbadv=a&mblid=d0c228da7811&mbcid=34260567.3476836&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), the real estate fund revolutionizing the “tenant-landlord” relationship, delivering historic annual returns above 16%, and helping its residents save and invest over $365k.

Here’s how it works:

* You invest with Roots with as little as $100.
* Roots acquires and manages the properties + finds residents.
* Residents build equity when they pay rent on time and take care of the property.

That lowers turnover costs, minimizes vacancies, and creates solid returns for all. Over $25m has been invested from over 3,500 investors.

The ruling said that the former president is now “citizen Trump” and that any claim he had to immunity as president is no longer there. The judge overseeing the DC criminal case, originally scheduled for trial in March, has put it on hold while the immunity issue gets hashed out.

Wall Street might want to put on some protective glasses as it watches Eli Lilly eclipse Tesla. After surpassing Elon Musk’s EV company in market cap last month, America’s biggest drugmaker reported [rockstar revenue](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g-q?mblid=ba54edbce6ff&mbcid=34260567.3476836&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) yesterday courtesy of its obesity and diabetes medications.

Blockbuster demand for Zepbound and Mounjaro helped the company post better-than-expected quarterly numbers:

* The pharma giant took in $9.35 billion in Q4 revenue, with quarterly profit up 13% from the previous year.
* That was thanks in part to Eli Lilly being able to charge more than before for Mounjaro and selling $175.8 million worth of Zepbound, which hit the market after gaining FDA approval in November.

## Weight loss = market gains

Eli Lilly’s stock has already risen 19% this year, with the WSJ [noting](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g-r?mblid=44748c4199c7&mbcid=34260567.3476836&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that its shares are priced like a glitzy fast-growing tech company’s. Lilly hopes to meet the growing Mounjaro and Zepbound demand by launching a new production facility in North Carolina later this year. Factset says analysts anticipate Zepbound sales will reach $1.9 billion in 2024, with the number growing to $12 billion in a few years.

**And yet, Eli Lilly execs are worried…**the company’s capacity to make the two drugs might be impacted by the parent of Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk planning to buy pharma supplier Catalent, which counts Eli Lilly as a customer._—SK_

Jack Sweeney, the brain behind various flight-tracking [social media accounts](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/g-x?mblid=97fdc4bd906c&mbcid=34260567.3476836&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), received a cease-and-desist letter from her lawyers in December, the Washington Post reported yesterday. The letter claimed his accounts caused “direct and irreparable harm” to Swift, who has dealt with stalkers throughout her career.

Scrutiny of Swift’s movements has hit all-time highs in the past few weeks.

* With all her jet-setting, Swift has also faced criticism for the carbon emissions caused by her private jet—data that gained attention because of Sweeney’s flight tracking.
