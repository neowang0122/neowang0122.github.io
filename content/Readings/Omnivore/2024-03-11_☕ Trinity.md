**Good morning.** Four years ago today, the WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Here’s a check-in on key metrics that show how life has—and hasn’t—changed since then.

* **Markets:** Wall Street hopes to sail into calmer waters after a [rocky week](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iai?mblid=edd5d58b6fb4&mbcid=34634234.3846467&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) sent the three major indexes falling.

[ ![Cillian Murphy in Oppenheimer ](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,sKtwr0wGH5tGEPxsa71mgJ8VH2tXuqkN5w3nWjH8nYds/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/62ba0bc8cd531342dca0aba289167365b7fa9fab-1500x1000.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ibu?mbcid=34634234.3846467&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) _Oppenheimer/Universal Pictures_ 

In an Oscars ceremony where the only thing stripped down was [John Cena](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ibv?mblid=1f9bde462eda&mbcid=34634234.3846467&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), the big movie won the biggest prize. _Oppenheimer_, Christopher Nolan’s epic about the creation of the atomic bomb, won best picture, while Nolan nabbed his first Academy Award for best director.

**It’s not typical Oscar fare:** While low-budget, indie flicks have dominated the best picture category for the past decade, _Oppenheimer_ proved to be a critical _and_ commercial success. With a nearly $1 billion haul at the box office, the movie was the highest-grossing best picture winner since _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_ in 2003.

In the major acting contests, Emma Stone won her second best actress award for _Poor Things_. And everyone finally learned how to pronounce “Cillian” correctly (it’s a “k” sound) when Cillian Murphy won best actor for his portrayal of Oppenheimer in…yeah.

**The world’s wars were top of mind:** Accepting the best documentary feature award for _20 Days in Mariupol_, director Mstyslav Chernov said, “I wish I’d never made this film,” which chronicled Russia’s attack on the Ukrainian city. And in his acceptance speech for best international feature, _The Zone of Interest_ director Jonathan Glazer decried the “dehumanization” of victims in the current Israel–Gaza conflict.

Some other highlights:

* Ryan Gosling brought the house down with a performance of “[I’m Just Ken](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ibw?mblid=e6924e68f785&mbcid=34634234.3846467&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)” from _Barbie_. Billie Eilish’s “What Was I Made For?” from the same movie scored the actual hardware for best original song. (It was _Barbie_’s only award.)
* Godzilla won its first Oscar in the franchise’s 70-year history. The team from _Godzilla Minus One_ took home the award for best visual effects (on a reported $15 million budget!) and also won the award for [best monster accessories](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ibx?mblid=f6200b5c2dd3&mbcid=34634234.3846467&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).
* John Mulaney described the [entire plot of _Field of Dreams_](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iby?mblid=8312580e0f44&mbcid=34634234.3846467&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)before presenting his category.

**Big picture:** Hollywood had a topsy-turvy year, with astounding highs (Barbenheimer) and extreme lows (an actors and writers strike for six months that froze film/TV production). Kimmel mentioned the strike in his monologue, reminded the audience that LA was a “union town,” and invited crew members working on the telecast to come onto the stage.

**Looking ahead…**the major nominees who didn’t win Oscars did not leave the Dolby Theater empty-handed. They received a [gift bag](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ibz?mblid=e23b899f252d&mbcid=34634234.3846467&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) with items worth nearly $180,000, including stays at resorts in Switzerland and St. Barts worth tens of thousands.

If getting through airport security continues to be a miserable experience, there will soon be nobody to blame but yourself.

Or the self in front of you.

The first TSA self-service screening system in the US [opens today](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ib5?mblid=bd74d60949a6&mbcid=34634234.3846467&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) at Harry Reid Airport in Las Vegas. PreCheck passengers can bet on getting to their gates with greater alacrity by scanning themselves and their bags while minimizing interactions with TSA agents.

**The six-month trial program could be the future.** Other airports could follow Vegas if the test proves successful. Self-screening aims to ease the growing burden on the TSA, which [screened](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ib6?mblid=b8d82f000b19&mbcid=34634234.3846467&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) between 1.6 million and 2.7 million passengers per day between Jan. 1 and March 7—more than all but three days over the same time period in 2023.

**You won’t necessarily get to Chili’s Too faster.** The self-screening program isn’t primarily about saving time. According to the Dept. of Homeland Security, it’s designed to create “a more pleasant, passenger-friendly experience” that lightens the workload of TSA agents, who will still be available for secondary screenings and might have understandably hurt feelings about a government-funded program designed specifically to keep them away from others._—DL_

In the first launch last April, the rocket was intentionally detonated four minutes into its flight.
