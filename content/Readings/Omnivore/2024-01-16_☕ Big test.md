Donald Trump scored big in Iowa yesterday as the state‚Äôs Republicans braved the cold [to vote](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gaQ?mblid=003067c208f8&mbcid=34007702.3534975&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) overwhelmingly to nominate him as their party‚Äôs presidential candidate. The Iowa caucuses kicked off the US primary season, and Trump‚Äôs victory came as polls show the ex-president will probably prevail over his GOP rivals, setting the stage for a likely Biden vs. Trump rematch.

* News organizations declared Trump the winner just 30 minutes after the caucuses began.
* Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took the second place spot, pulling ahead of Nikki Haley and gaining some momentum as the alternative candidate heading into the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23\. Vivek Ramaswamy ended his campaign after a poor showing.

## Meanwhile‚Ä¶

Half a world away from Iowa‚Äôs iced-over cornfields, a potential second Trump presidency is [sending chills](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gae?mblid=a5c111f8da58&mbcid=34007702.3534975&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) down the spines of the jet set gathered in the Swiss Alps for the annual World Economic Forum this week. Davos is abuzz with anxiety as world leaders, CEOs, and luminaries mull the implications of another Trump presidency for cross-border trade, security, and climate efforts.

* European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde [recently warned](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gaf?mblid=c3a68d11213f&mbcid=34007702.3534975&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that a Trump return is ‚Äúclearly a threat‚Äù to Europe. She cited the tariffs he imposed as president, plus his record of NATO skepticism and climate change denial.
* BlackRock Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand told Bloomberg that Trump represents a concern ‚Äúfrom a kind of globalist, Atlanticist perspective.‚Äù

Their fears aren‚Äôt totally unfounded: While campaigning, Trump has proposed a 10% tariff on all imported goods. And European Commissioner Thierry Breton recalled last week that during a conversation at Davos in 2020, Trump said that ‚ÄúNATO is dead‚Äù and warned that the US wouldn‚Äôt defend Europe if it were attacked.

Others worry that Trump would scale back US support for Ukraine. Czech President Petr Pavel told a national publication that Vladimir Putin is waiting for the 2024 US presidential election results before starting peace talks.

The prospect of a Trump win [looms over](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gag?mblid=4edc1f124d9b&mbcid=34007702.3534975&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the world‚Äôs climate policymakers, too, as he could be expected to roll back environmental regulations and cut funding for green initiatives.

**Looking ahead‚Ä¶**though Trump is the front-runner in the polls and in funds raised, the Iowa caucuses don‚Äôt always predict the nominee. _‚ÄîSK_

As an arctic blast grips parts of the US, Texans are hoping their improved power grid can stand up to today‚Äôs extreme weather better than Dak Prescott stood up to the Green Bay Packers.

**There‚Äôs reason to believe that it will.** The state‚Äôs grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, better known as ERCOT, has beefed up operations since winter storms caused devastating power blackouts in 2021\.

Last week, Gov. Greg Abbott said that the state‚Äôs power generators have ‚Äúnever been as prepared for a winter event as they are today.‚Äù Still, ERCOT urged Texans to conserve energy on Monday and Tuesday morning to help prevent potential blackouts since the grid is most vulnerable between 7am‚Äì8am, when people wake up and start turning on the lights.

Recent [research](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gax?mblid=939bedb1b36f&mbcid=34007702.3534975&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) has shown that the mental healthcare platform Spring Health helped workers manage their depression and miss fewer days of work, leading to more productivity (aka why organizations spend money on these programs in the first place).

She noted this could fuel inequality since, in some cases, AI will boost productivity while in others, it will dry up demand for labor that was once done by humans.
