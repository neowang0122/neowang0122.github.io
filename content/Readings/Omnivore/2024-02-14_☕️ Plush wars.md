But things were rosier for JetBlue, which skyrocketed nearly 22% on the news that activist investor Carl Icahn bought a 10% stake in the airline.

### ECONOMY

## [ Inflation is in retreat, but prices still bite ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hfP?mbcid=34341280.3938971&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)

Off-the-charts inflation may be a distant 2022 phenomenon, but—unlike the buzz around the Oscars slap—we’re not entirely over it. Price growth is [still not back](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hfQ?mblid=2e2f1f569ce5&mbcid=34341280.3938971&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to levels that would satisfy Jay Powell, and shoppers continue to deal with the fallout.

Prices grew faster than economists expected last month, according to the consumer price index data the government released yesterday.

* They climbed 0.3% in January (slightly more than in December) and 3.1% from a year prior.
* Excluding food and energy prices, January’s inflation was 0.4%, a bit over December’s reading, and 3.9% more than the prior January.

Finance freaks who talk about interest rates in social settings will point out that things aren’t so bad, since inflation isn’t too far from the Fed’s 2% annual target. But shoppers might argue that just because prices are growing more slowly doesn’t mean things are costing them less.

## Checkout aisle blues

While used cars and clothes became cheaper last month, a big jump in housing costs was the culprit for most of last month’s consumer price growth. Food is also getting more expensive: Grocery prices rose more than in previous months, while dining out became 5.1% pricier than a year before.

Food inflation has also taken more insidious forms. Some brands are engaging in a devious tactic dubbed “shrinkflation”—keeping sticker prices the same while reducing the portion contained within a package. President Biden shared a [video](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hfR?mblid=4828b3cdf5fc&mbcid=34341280.3938971&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) on Super Bowl Sunday in which he scolded companies for selling downsized game day snacks without downsized prices.

He’s hoping the message will hit a nerve with Americans who’ve been feeling glum about the economy despite low unemployment, rising wages, and a surging stock market.

**As for the mythical rate cuts…**the latest inflation report makes it more likely the Fed will wait longer to lower interest rates._—SK_

Republicans tried for months to impeach Mayorkas, even though bipartisan legal scholars say his actions do not constitute “high crimes and misdemeanors” required for a conviction, while many observers argue the impeachment attempt itself is unconstitutional. Mayorkas is now the first sitting cabinet member in US history to be impeached. The charges are likely to be rejected in the Senate.

National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that talks were “moving in the right direction” but cautioned that “nothing is done until it is all done.” President Biden said the US-brokered deal would free hostages and pause fighting for about six weeks.

If your romantic plans for today involve calling a car to get to your date, ordering in, or picking up your paramour from the airport, you may want to fire up Plan B.

As part of a nationwide strike by Uber and Lyft drivers and DoorDash delivery workers, more than 130,000 workers are expected to [refuse rides](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hf%5F?mblid=7629873dcf9a&mbcid=34341280.3938971&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to and from airports in 10 US cities from 11am to 1pm today. An estimated 3,000 Deliveroo and UberEats drivers in the UK will also halt work for five hours.

The strike, on one of the busiest days of the year for ride-hailing and delivery apps, comes a week after Lyft announced it would guarantee weekly earnings in a bid to [attract more drivers](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hg0?mblid=6311c5e8c1cd&mbcid=34341280.3938971&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), and Uber posted its first annual profit since going public. Lyft has had a bumpy ride this week: Its stock shot up yesterday in after-hours trading due to a typo in its earnings release, and then pulled back once it was corrected.

**Why are they striking?** Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-algorithm. Since companies started using an algorithmic pricing model, drivers are no longer guaranteed a fixed payout from a ride, and many have seen their earnings [decrease](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hg1?mblid=96bebf99dac1&mbcid=34341280.3938971&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). In 2023:

* Uber drivers’ monthly average take-home earnings fell 17%, according to gig data provider Gridwise.
* Roughly 15% of Lyft drivers in the US earned less than 70% of what riders paid.

**But…**Uber claims drivers in the US make roughly $33/hour and are satisfied with their earnings. It also said it doesn’t expect the strike to have a significant impact on trips or prices._—CC_

A very soft legal battle is brewing between two powerful plush-makers. Jazwares, the owner of the popular Squishmallows toys, [sued](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hfo?mblid=404a5dbfc652&mbcid=34341280.3938971&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) rival Build-A-Bear, claiming the latter’s Skoosherz stuffed creatures are a knock-off of its flagship product. Build-A-Bear then countersued, arguing it’s not against the law to slap a tiny face on a pillow.

**Some background…**Squishmallows [exploded in popularity](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hfp?mblid=0d7fe81bf05f&mbcid=34341280.3938971&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) with the help of celebrity buzz and TikTok mentions during the pandemic. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway got hold of those cuddly guys when the firm purchased a $12 billion controlling stake in Jazwares in 2022\. A Squishmallows offering was the most popular toy of that year, per research firm Circana, with 100 million units sold.

Last month, Build-A-Bear began selling its own line of huggable, round stuffed animals with small smiles. Jazwares claims the toys are too close to its own with their “simplified Asian-style kawaii faces.” 

**This legal battle isn’t just for shelf space.** The stuffed animal industry is Beanie Babies mania-level hot right now, especially for adults. Plushie sales were [up 4%](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hfq?mblid=d6e22ce0d5f7&mbcid=34341280.3938971&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) last year, hitting $1.7 billion in October even as overall toy sales decreased.

**Stat:** What do apes, elephants, and whales have in common, other than being NFT collections? Sadly, they are among the 44% of migratory species with declining populations, according to a new United Nations report. One-fifth of the 1,200 migratory species monitored by the UN are [threatened with extinction](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hff?mblid=66f3d6da8f56&mbcid=34341280.3938971&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). While some conservation efforts like wildlife crossings and poaching regulations are helping species relocate safely, experts say those initiatives need to be strengthened. The report follows a 2019 UN assessment that found that 1 million of the Earth’s 8 million species are at risk of extinction due to overconsumption, pollution, and other human activities.
