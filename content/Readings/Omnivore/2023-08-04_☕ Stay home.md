Travel within the US is down this summer, and airlines are slashing prices in the hopes that a $60 ticket will be cheap enough to convince you to visit Cleveland.

Earlier this week, US-focused JetBlue cut its earnings forecast for the year and warned of a loss in Q3\. Other primarily domestic airlines are also experiencing turbulence:

* Alaska Airlines has slashed fares, while Southwest, Spirit, and Frontier held flight [promotions](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahg?mblid=687a4940feaa&mbcid=32291768.3811776&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) this summer—a sign of struggle within the industry.
* US round-trip fares are down 11% compared to 2022 and 2019, according to Hopper.com.

**Meanwhile…**American Airlines, Delta, and United—all carriers with global operations—have exceeded expectations and kept prices high. International airfare is averaging $962, up 10% from last year and 26% from 2019, per Hopper.

## Bucket list trips > sand bucket trips

Why are people traveling outside the US? It’s not exactly a mystery: Americans who were stuck in the country for nearly two years are ready to put their Duolingo streak to the ultimate test. Mastercard said that spending linked to overseas travel is currently at 154% of pre-pandemic levels.

**So…where is everyone?**

* Predictably, a lot of Americans are in [Europe](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahh?mblid=bbb5d5328e0b&mbcid=32291768.3811776&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). According to Allianz, the number of Americans traveling to Europe this year will be 55% more than last summer, with London, Paris, Dublin, and Rome as the top destinations.
* Travel to Pacific countries, including China and Japan, has also popped off. American Airlines said passenger revenue for trans-Pacific routes has more than tripled in the first half of the year.

All the international travel has left American attractions feeling a little empty inside. Major theme parks, including Disney World, Universal, Six Flags, and SeaWorld, have all reported lower-than-usual attendance rates this summer.—_CC_

Start preparing for an onslaught of gas-pump pics on social media with the caption, “Thanks, Biden!” The national average of gas rose to a nine-month high of $3.82 per gallon yesterday, up 11 cents from a week ago, per AAA.

So, what’s driving prices higher? A noxious mix of heat and geopolitics.

**The heat:** It was so hot in July that refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, which aren’t designed for temps over 95 degrees, are struggling to produce gasoline. That, paired with increased demand for fuel over the summer (so many late-night drives blaring Charli XCX’s “Speed Drive”), means gasoline inventories in the country have fallen to their [lowest](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahq?mblid=93cdaafb1b30&mbcid=32291768.3811776&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) July level since 2015.

**The geopolitics:** Major oil producer Saudi Arabia said yesterday it would [extend](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahr?mblid=a1c22288183b&mbcid=32291768.3811776&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) its output cuts into September and could even deepen those cuts after that, according to state media. By curbing supply, Saudi Arabia hopes to prop up the price of oil—which gives it critical revenue to spend on futuristic cities and Ronaldo’s teammates. But the cuts are angering the White House because they could lead to an uptick in US inflation.

**Looking ahead...**the rise in gas prices may not last. Refinery operations are [returning](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahs?mblid=9359c24e54aa&mbcid=32291768.3811776&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to normal, and demand usually tapers off in August, according to an AAA spokesperson. But a worse-than-average hurricane season could present unforeseen challenges._—MM_

Lizzo fans fell to their knees this week upon hearing that she’s being sued by three former dancers for the type of alleged mistreatment she’s known for standing against.

And like most celebrities who suddenly find themselves on the verge of getting canceled, the “Truth Hurts” singer posted a Notes App “apology” on Instagram and X yesterday in which she called the accusations “false” and “as unbelievable as they sound.”

The lawsuit [alleges](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/aaS?mblid=d59cb60062de&mbcid=32291768.3811776&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that between May 2021 and May 2023…

* Lizzo pressured dancers into interacting with nude performers at an Amsterdam club.
* Lizzo’s dance captain pushed religious beliefs on the other dancers and publicly fixated on one plaintiff’s abstinence.
* Members of the dance cast, described as “full-figured women of color” in the suit, were scolded when they asked for better compensation for tour downtime.
* An “excruciating” rehearsal left one plaintiff so fearful of being let go for underperforming that she soiled herself rather than take a bathroom break. She says she was later fired for recording a meeting, and that Lizzo’s security team didn’t let her leave until they searched her phone for the video.

Since the lawsuit was announced, three more women who used to work with Lizzo have [said](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahx?mblid=ab700f8200bd&mbcid=32291768.3811776&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) they had similar experiences with the singer…but Lizzo maintains the allegations are just “sensationalized stories.”_—ML_

**Stat:** Ugh, the CEOs ordering you to return to the office just got some fresh backup from science. A new working paper in the National Bureau of Economic Research found that data entry employees in Chennai, India, randomly assigned to work from home were [18% less productive](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ahB?mblid=7e11a01fe132&mbcid=32291768.3811776&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) than employees who worked at the office.
