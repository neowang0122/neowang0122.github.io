Career Fair Days provides a forum for Cornellians to meet with more than 250 employers over a two-day period. A wide variety of employers attend, ranging from Fortune 500 companies to government and not-for-profit organizations. These organizations attend Cornell University’s Career Fair Days to increase visibility, to illustrate the benefits of employment in their organization, and to provide information to Cornell students about entry- level jobs, co-op opportunities, and internships. Many of these organizations also participate through Cornell’s On-Campus Recruiting Program and use Career Fair Days as a kick-off for their recruiting season. Others attend to introduce Cornell students to their organization; some collect resumes for future openings.
