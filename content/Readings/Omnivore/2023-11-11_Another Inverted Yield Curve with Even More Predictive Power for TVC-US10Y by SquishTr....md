 The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke again today at a Brookings Institution event. His comments sparked a rally in markets (likely including short covering) that pushed the S&P 500 [ ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,s8BvRwB0dQVHJHWwqncc1juslu2e8t1K5NZJOVxsapSs/https://s3-symbol-logo.tradingview.com/indices/s-and-p-500.svg) SPX ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SPX/) up about 122 points, or 3.10%, to close at 4080\. The Nasdaq 100 [ ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sFHJSW2-54MuNd5JaEloVlUOOAZZqFZBvW8E6pYw72jc/https://s3-symbol-logo.tradingview.com/indices/nasdaq-100.svg) NDX ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-NDX/) rose 4.58% on the day, closing at 12,030\. 

But the bond market is sending less sanguine signals. The 10Y/3M yield curve inverted further today. Its inversion is currently the deepest since the slightly deeper inversion of this segment of the yield curve in 2000-2001 inversion, which had presaged the 2-year bear market from 2000-2002\. 

The 10Y/3M curve has been researched more than the more widely known 10Y/2Y curve (also known as the 10s/2s). Experts say inversions of the 10Y/3M serve as better predictors of recession than the 10Y/2Y curve. 

==The yield curve has remained inverted for over a month now. This qualifies as a "persistent inversion" that creates a recession signal. But the recession does not always follow immediately. According to Jim Bianco of Bianco Research LLC, "The average lead time" until the recession arises "is 311 days, or about 10 months."== 

What does this offer for traders then? On days when equity markets are rallying like there is no tomorrow, it tells us that markets are not out of the woods despite the buying frenzy. It means that a recession is more probable than not in the next year. But it doesn't tell us much about where prices are headed in the near term (technical analysis of price itself works better for this purpose). Just because a recession will likely begin in the coming weeks or months does not necessitate that equity markets plummet in a straight line to the ideal target. Many, including this author, wishes it could be as straightforward and predictable. 

So traders should also keep in mind that inverted curves are not a trading signal. They are part of the broader economic and rate-policy context within which equity markets operate. It helps me to know that markets are not likely to resume a long-term uptrend until the recession has ended. 

The bond market tends to sniff out the problems in the economy long before other markets. And equity markets can ride on hope and desperation for much longer than anyone expects—just as this unexpected bear rally carried SPX price from the October 13, 2022 low all the way back above the 200-day MA today and higher to close at 4080.11\. 

Below is a chart of the 10Y/2Y yield curve, which is also inverted. 

Supplementary Chart A:

To compare the current 10Y/2Y inversion with some historic inversions, consider reading this prior post from July 2022 on the 2s / 10s yield curve inversion, and be sure to hit the refresh button to see the most recent months of data. The Wall Street Journal Confirmed in recent days, by the way, that the 2s / 10s curve

Finally, on a monthly chart, one can easily see that the 2s / 10s curve inversion is the deepest one on record—at least as far back as the chart allows. Hat tip to [@SpyMasterTrades](https://www.tradingview.com/u/SpyMasterTrades/) for pointing this record-breaking inversion recently.
