While you are abroad, emergencies may arise. While they can be stressful and even frightening, emergencies are easier to handle when you know where to turn for help.

### Medical Emergency?

1\. The traveler should go to the nearest clinic or hospital.

2\. Call [International SOS (ISOS)](https://global.cornell.edu/travel/planning/247-travel-assistance "24/7 Travel Assistance"), Cornell's medical insurance/assistance provider, at their 24/7 emergency assistance line: +1-215-942-8478 (or use [the mobile app(link is external)](https://www.internationalsos.com/subscriber/assistance-app)).

* Provide ISOS with the traveler's name, policy number (11BSCA827281), and other information requested by ISOS.
* ISOS will monitor your case closely to determine if medical care is appropriate, including whether adequate local resources are available.
* Often, ISOS can arrange for direct payment to the medical facility for treatment. If an insurance medical situation and ISOS cannot directly pay the medical facility, the traveler will be reimbursed for the cost of treatment (all receipts must be provided).

3\. Students studying abroad should notify their program/resident director as soon as possible. 

4\. If there is no on-site staff associated with the program, or the patient is traveling independently of a group, contact [IHSS](https://global.cornell.edu/travel "Travel") to advise them of your emergency once your situation is stable or safe enough to do so ([intlsafety@cornell.edu(link sends email)](mailto:intlsafety@cornell.edu))

## Accidents and Health Emergencies

### What if I need to call for the police, fire truck, or ambulance?

Not all countries have a central emergency dispatch you can call for help. However, they may have dedicated country-wide numbers for police, fire, and ambulance. Here is a list of local ["911" equivalents around the world.(link is external)](https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/students-abroad/pdfs/911%5FABROAD.pdf)

### What do I do if I am injured or sick (non-life threatening) while I am abroad?

### How do I find a reputable doctor abroad?

### How do I access mental health counseling while I'm abroad?

### I was just involved in a motor vehicle accident. What do I do?

### I had a motor vehicle accident while on Cornell business. What do I need to do?

## Victim of a Crime

### Should I call the local police if I am a crime victim?

Yes, if it safe to do so, contact the local police to report the incident and get immediate help. Request a copy of the police report. Consult the list of local [“911” equivalents around the world.(link is external)](https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/students-abroad/pdfs/911%5FABROAD.pdf)

### I had documents stolen. Who do I turn to for help?

### How can I get information about local laws?

### Can the U.S. Embassy help me if I am a crime victim?

### Victim of Sexual Assault

### I have just been sexually assaulted. What is the first thing I should do?

### Should I contact local police if I have been sexually assaulted?

As a sexual assault victim, you are also the victim of a crime. See the “[Victim of a Crime](#crime)” section for information on how to contact the police and other authorities in-country. Be aware that in some countries, local authorities may not be as helpful or understanding as you might expect in the United States, and in a few countries, it may not be advisable to report the incident to local authorities at all. [ISOS](https://global.cornell.edu/travel/planning/247-travel-assistance "24/7 Travel Assistance") can help navigate local laws and customs if there is any question on what the best course of action may be. 

### Where can I get information on local culture and attitudes toward sexual assault?

If you are a U.S. citizen and have questions about the local culture and attitudes toward sexual assault, contact the [U.S. Department of State (link is external)](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies.html)from overseas by calling +1-202-501-4444\. You can also contact [ISOS](https://global.cornell.edu/travel/planning/247-travel-assistance "24/7 Travel Assistance") for similar advice. 

### Where can I get more information and support as a victim of sexual assault?

### I was sexually assaulted or the victim of a sex or gender-based offense. Do I have to report it?

### I am a faculty or staff member, and a student told me about an alleged sexual assault. What are my obligations and responsibilities?

If you are a [designated reporter,(link is external)](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/blogs.cornell.edu/dist/6/7016/files/2020/09/Policy-6.4-Designated-Reporters-8.14.2020.pdf) you have a duty to consult with the Title IX Coordinator if you learn of a report of sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, or sexual harassment involving a student. Additionally, if you are a Cornell supervisor or manager, you have a duty to report when you learn of sexual harassment in the workplace. Report what you know, including the names of those involved, to the Cornell [Title IX Coordinator(link is external)](http://titleix.cornell.edu/) in the Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX. 

Sometimes cultural differences may make it hard to understand the scope of the experience being reported. In this case, you should still share information about what was reported to you with the Title IX Coordinator. The coordinator will confidentially reach out to the reporter and offer information about their different rights, options, and resources in the wake of their difficult experience.

### Terrorism, Violent Uprising, or Natural Disaster

### What should I do if there is in-country violence or a natural disaster?

### Will U.S. authorities contact me about the dangerous political/social/environmental situation? 

If you are a U.S. citizen enrolled through the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)(link is external)](https://step.state.gov/step/), the U.S. Department of State (DoS) will notify you, initially by email, of the situation and advise you about what to do.

If you are a non-U.S. citizen, you can also sign up to receive travel alerts and advisories from the DoS by email, but you will not have access to the same emergency services. We advise you to check with your own embassy for similar programs.

ISOS will also send alerts and advice, via email and the mobile app, to you as a registered traveler when an event may have a negative impact on your itinerary.

### Will Cornell help me if my in-country situation becomes dangerous?

### Arrest or Detention Abroad

### I have been arrested. What should I do?

If you have been arrested, immediately do the following:

* Personally notify, or ask the prison authorities to notify, your country's embassy or consulate. Here is a list of [U.S. Embassies and Consulates around the world.(link is external)](https://www.usembassy.gov/) In most cases, government agencies are not able to inform or share information about your situation with Cornell unless you have given express (often written) consent.
* Contact your supervisor or trip leader, and relatives.
* Let IHSS know of your arrest by calling [ISOS](https://global.cornell.edu/travel/planning/247-travel-assistance "24/7 Travel Assistance") at [**+1-215-942-8478**](tel:+12159428478), or via [intlsafety@cornell.edu(link sends email)](mailto:intlsafety@cornell.edu) or through the [online international incident report form(link is external)](https://cornell.guardianconduct.com/incident-reporting)[.(link is external)](https://cornell.guardianconduct.com/incident-reporting)

### Missing persons

### How do I let Cornell know that a Cornell traveler has gone missing?

### Who should I notify in-country that a Cornell traveler has gone missing?

If safe to do so, notify the local police and file a missing person report. If applicable, notify the host institution/organization as well. They can often help navigate the local authorities and processes.

Also, notify the nearest Embassy or Consulate of the person’s citizenship. Here is a list of [U.S. Embassies and Consulates around the world(link is external)](https://www.usembassy.gov/).

Note that the U.S. Consular officers will reach out to hospitals and law enforcement agencies to see if U.S. citizens were admitted or arrested but cannot divulge their findings without the written permission of the missing person.
