# Full Content: 

If you are running a business, your goal, generally, is to make money. A lot of people go to business school to learn how to do it, and those people — maybe you’re one of them, takes those newly found lessons to work at large corporations.  
如果您经营一家企业，那么您的目标通常是赚钱。很多人去商学院学习如何做到这一点，而这些人（也许你就是其中之一）将这些新发现的课程带到大公司工作。

One of these titans of industry, a guy by the name of Jim McNerney, came into power at a certain business around the year 2005, where he operated on the principle that companies “overvalued experience and undervalued leadership.”  
其中一位名叫吉姆·麦克纳尼 (Jim McNerney) 的行业巨头于 2005 年左右在一家企业掌权，他的经营原则是公司“高估经验，低估领导力”。

The idea is absurd from the outset. No person of even remote intelligence would say “yes, let’s get rid of people who know what they’re doing to hire people who don’t know what they’re doing but have a lot of authority.” We’ve all worked for idiots before, we know what that’s like. What good is someone who doesn’t know anything?  
这个想法从一开始就是荒谬的。即使是具有远程智慧的人也不会说“是的，让我们解雇那些知道自己在做什么的人，而去雇用那些不知道自己在做什么但拥有很多权力的人。”我们以前都曾为白痴工作过，我们知道那是什么感觉。一个什么都不懂的人有什么好处？

But it’s a common trend in every industry, from David Zaslav to, well, Jim McNerney’s successor, Dan Calhoun, who’s going to resign from Boeing under allegations that his corporation had a whistleblower killed after multiple mishaps and hundreds — literally hundreds — of deaths that should see McNerney locked up in ADX Florence until the day he dies.  
但这是每个行业的普遍趋势，从大卫·扎斯拉夫（David Zaslav）到吉姆·麦克纳尼（Jim McNerney）的继任者丹·卡尔霍恩（Dan Calhoun），丹·卡尔霍恩将辞去波音公司的职务，因为有人指控他的公司在多次事故和数百人（实际上是数百人）死亡后，有一名举报人被杀。应该看到麦克纳尼被关在 ADX Florence 直到他去世的那一天。

Think about it: because of Jim McNerney’s direction, Boeing’s ‘leadership’ was responsible for more deaths than the Oklahoma City Bombing.  
想想看：由于吉姆·麦克纳尼的指挥，波音公司的“领导”造成的死亡人数比俄克拉荷马城爆炸事件还要多。

Pictured: a terrorist bombing, one of the worst in American History, that killed less than half the people Jim McNerney’s leadership did.  
图为：美国历史上最严重的恐怖爆炸事件之一，造成的死亡人数不到吉姆·麦克纳尼领导下死亡人数的一半。

_When you’re done with this article, I think you should read the one where I got the ‘_[_overvalued experience_](https://prospect.org/infrastructure/transportation/2024-03-28-suicide-mission-boeing/)_’ quote from._  
当您读完本文后，我认为您应该阅读我引用的“经验被高估”的那篇文章。

We are faced with a very, very stupid world. I am here to help you figure out how to overcome some of its challenges, at least as it pertains to your business.  
我们面临着一个非常非常愚蠢的世界。我来这里是为了帮助您找出如何克服其中的一些挑战，至少是与您的业务相关的挑战。

Look, I’m gonna come at this from the thing I know well: helping people get 8–9 figure projects across the finish line, making sure their 10–11–12-figure (yes, that’s 100 billion dollar) corporations make a lot of money. I’m very, very good at what I do.  
听着，我将从我熟悉的事情中得出这个结论：帮助人们完成 8-9 位数的项目，确保他们的 10-11-12 位数（是的，这是 1000 亿美元）的公司创造一个大量的资金。我非常非常擅长我所做的事情。

If you’ve played AAA games in the past ten or so years, you’ve almost certainly played games I’ve worked on. I know the business pretty well, and I know product _really_ well. I know how to help businesses make money. I’m currently in the process of convincing people that a business led by me will make a great deal of money, and so far, the publishers currently invested in my studio look like they’ll be making a whole lot of money off my work because of the amount of money they’ve put into us.  
如果您在过去十年左右的时间里玩过 AAA 游戏，那么您几乎肯定玩过我制作的游戏。我非常了解业务，也非常了解产品。我知道如何帮助企业赚钱。我目前正在说服人们相信我领导的企业会赚很多钱，到目前为止，目前投资我工作室的出版商看起来他们会从我的作品中赚很多钱因为他们向我们投入了大量资金。

If you want to make a lot of money, you should _definitely_ fund Mischief.  
如果你想赚很多钱，你绝对应该资助 Mischief。

But, if you’re reading this article, you’re probably someone running your own business, or someone frustrated _with_ business and you want to know why. Awesome. This is something you’re going to want to read. While I’ll be talking in the context of game developers, this applies to _any business at all_. If you want to make money, I’m going to tell you all about how, at the very least, not to lose that money.  
但是，如果您正在阅读本文，您可能正在经营自己的企业，或者对业务感到沮丧，并且您想知道原因。惊人的。这是你想读的东西。虽然我将在游戏开发者的背景下谈论，但这适用于任何企业。如果你想赚钱，我会告诉你如何至少不损失这笔钱。

## It Starts With… 一切始于……

One thing, I don’t know why, is the idea that running a company makes you inherently special. McNerney refers to this as _leadership_, but there’s no actual leading occurring. The idea is that if you are _classified_ as a leader, you… possess some… innate qualities of such. This is far from the truth. Having the position and being good at it are two different things, right?  
有一点，我不知道为什么，那就是经营一家公司会让你天生与众不同。麦克纳尼将此称为领导力，但实际上并没有发生任何领导力。这个想法是，如果你被归类为领导者，那么你……拥有一些……与生俱来的品质。这远非真相。拥有这个职位和擅长这个职位是两件事，对吗？

If you hang around Silicon Valley or LinkedIn enough, you’ll hear people use hushed, reverent tones to describe “Founders.” Founders, in their minds, are heroic visionaries who, through no insignificant effort, manage to carve a tremendous, powerful vision out of _nothing_.  
如果你经常在硅谷或 LinkedIn 闲逛，你会听到人们用安静、虔诚的语气来形容“创始人”。在他们心目中，创始人是英雄般的梦想家，他们通过不平凡的努力，从无到有地创造了一个巨大而强大的愿景。

Of course, Sam Bankman-Fried going to jail for twenty five years for committing ten billion dollars in fraud and being required to pay back eleven billion is a great example of why maybe just ‘founding’ something doesn’t matter.  
当然，山姆·班克曼-弗里德 (Sam Bankman-Fried) 因诈骗 100 亿美元而被判入狱 25 年，并被要求偿还 110 亿美元，这就是一个很好的例子，说明为什么仅仅“创立”某件事并不重要。

I’ve helped people found companies. I’ve founded companies. It’s easy. You can go to a website and punch in some information, and boom. Founder.  
我帮助人们找到了公司。我创办过公司。这很容易。你可以访问一个网站并输入一些信息，然后就可以了。创始人。

In other words, being in the position of founding a company doesn’t mean shit. A lot of people in Silicon Valley want to view themselves as the next Steve Jobs. They try to get magazine covers, they try to develop their own kind of fashion (the only person who’s actually managed to pull this off is Jensen Huang), they try to build a _profile_ as a new, big up and comer.  
换句话说，能够创办一家公司并不意味着什么。硅谷的很多人都希望将自己视为下一个史蒂夫·乔布斯。他们试图登上杂志封面，他们试图发展自己的时尚（唯一真正成功做到这一点的人是黄仁勋），他们试图建立一个新的、大的后起之秀的形象。

And, like Elizabeth Holmes, you go to jail for 11 years, or Sam Bankman-Fried, you go to jail for 25 years, when you invariably do everything in your power to set up a business that _doesn’t fucking work_ and loses a lot of people money, especially when those people include The Walton Family, Henry Kissinger, and people like that.  
而且，就像伊丽莎白·霍姆斯（Elizabeth Holmes）一样，你会被判入狱 11 年，或者萨姆·班克曼-弗里德（Sam Bankman-Fried）会被判入狱 25 年，当你总是竭尽全力创办一家根本不运作并失去利润的企业时，你就会被判入狱 25 年。很多人有钱，特别是当这些人包括沃尔顿家族、亨利·基辛格和类似的人时。

Where each one of these people failed is that their businesses didn’t create anything of value. More specifically, many of these businesses have no product or model. There was a lot of money floating around, an idea, but no _actual serious business_ occurring.  
这些人的失败之处在于他们的企业没有创造任何价值。更具体地说，其中许多企业没有产品或模式。有很多钱在流动，只是一个想法，但没有发生真正严肃的事情。

Bankman-Fried allegedly impressed people by… not taking them seriously. He would play League while talking, do what he could to convince people he was some sensitive, stable genius, but when you read the court cases and the evidence, it’s obvious he was just some fuckin moron who was good at fast talk trying to hustle investors out of their money, and they were stupid enough to get conned by it.  
据称，班克曼-弗里德给人们留下的印象是……没有认真对待他们。他会一边说话一边玩英雄联盟，尽其所能地让人们相信他是一个敏感、稳定的天才，但当你阅读法庭案件和证据时，很明显他只是一个他妈的白痴，擅长快速说话，试图催促别人。投资者的钱被掏空了，他们愚蠢到被它欺骗了。

Remember when I [wrote about NFTs](https://docseuss.medium.com/look-what-you-made-me-do-a-lot-of-people-have-asked-me-to-make-nft-games-and-i-wont-because-i-m-29c7cfdbbb79)? Or when I [wrote about them the second time](https://docseuss.medium.com/look-what-i-made-for-you-apparently-while-i-am-not-a-dumbass-many-cryptobros-are-and-i-am-going-f6468c877acc)? What did I say?  
还记得我写过关于 NFT 的文章吗？或者当我第二次写到它们时？我说了什么？

The core problem with NFTs is that they didn’t have actual good use cases. No one could argue for a product or service any customer would actually want. The ideas being put forward were being put forward by people who did not understand how the product in question functioned.  
NFT 的核心问题是它们没有实际的良好用例。没有人可以争论任何客户真正想要的产品或服务。提出的想法是由不了解相关产品如何运作的人提出的。

What happened? 发生了什么？

Well, a shitload of people lost a shitload of money. A shitload of _businesses_ lost a shitload of money. How much money did A16Z lose on NFTs? Wouldn’t surprise me if it was a lot, what with the massive overnight collapse of the market. _Nobody ever wanted NFTs_, except a very small group of [Beanie Baby](https://www.history.com/news/how-the-beanie-baby-craze-came-to-a-crashing-end) or [Tulip speculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip%5Fmania) who were hopeful that a lot of very stupid people would show up and hold the bag. Those very stupid people did not materialize.  
好吧，很多人损失了很多钱。大量企业损失了大量资金。 A16Z 在 NFT 上损失了多少钱？如果这个数字很大，我也不会感到惊讶，因为市场隔夜大幅崩盘。没有人想要 NFT，除了极少数 Beanie Baby 或 Tulip 投机者，他们希望很多非常愚蠢的人会出现并承担责任。那些非常愚蠢的人并没有出现。

No one wanted to be a customer for such a useless fucking product as “a receipt saying you own something that, through its very nature, is infinitely duplicable.” An NFT is a note that says “I promise to pretend I can’t copy this when it’s literally effortless to do so.” It’s stupid as shit. Always was.  
没有人愿意成为这种无用的该死产品的顾客，比如“一张收据，表明你拥有某种本质上可以无限复制的东西”。 NFT 是一张纸条，上面写着“我保证假装我无法复制这个，而实际上这是毫不费力的”。这太愚蠢了。一直都是。

As it turns out, exclusivity _doesn’t motivate people as much as you think_. In fact, exclusivity actually [drives people away](https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5xkgw/why-destiny-2-isnt-working-and-how-to-fix-it). Look at how Bungie’s Destiny is collapsing horribly and has been since they started emphasizing exclusivity.  
事实证明，排他性并没有你想象的那么能激励人们。事实上，排他性实际上会让人远离。看看 Bungie’s Destiny 自从他们开始强调排他性以来，是如何可怕地崩溃的。

I mean, as best we can tell, an artist named Beeple kicked this off. If you don’t know who Beeple is, he was a dude who would make a piece of art every day by grabbing assets from other artists and putting them together. Usually it would be of, like, Trump shitting himself or something.  
我的意思是，据我们所知，是一位名叫 Beeple 的艺术家开始了这一切。如果你不知道 Beeple 是谁，他是一个每天都会通过从其他艺术家那里获取资产并将它们组合在一起来创作一件艺术品的家伙。通常是特朗普在拉屎自己什么的。

Beeple, apparently, had a friend who ran an NFT marketplace. They organized a showcase at a Christie’s auction where they artificially pumped up the value to make people think it was desirable — that there was a market here. There wasn’t.  
Beeple 显然有一位经营 NFT 市场的朋友。他们在佳士得拍卖会上组织了一场展示会，人为地抬高了价格，让人们认为这是令人向往的——这里有市场。没有。

And we _kept seeing people do that_. Time and time again, someone would put up an item, an accomplice would try to drive the value up, and then the people running the marketplaces — who get cuts of every transaction — would say “look, see, there’s a market here.”  
我们不断看到人们这样做。一次又一次，有人会提出一个项目，同谋会试图提高价格，然后运营市场的人——他们从每笔交易中获得分成——会说“看，看，这里有一个市场。”

There was no market because there were no customers.  
因为没有顾客，所以没有市场。

If there are no customers, then you have no business, and eventually, the fraud comes out and you end up being ordered by the judge to pay _eleven billion dollars_ to your creditors, despite the fact that you’re a vegan and you’ve repeatedly told everyone how ethical you are. I don’t know _why_ Bankman-Fried’s lawyers keep insisting his veganism is why he shouldn’t go to jail for one of the largest financial crimes in history, with thousands of victims, but they really do think being vegan makes you moral. The worst people I’ve ever known were vegans. Some of the best people I’ve ever known were vegans. Veganism is not a moral determiner, Sam.  
如果没有顾客，那么你就没有生意，最终，欺诈行为就会出现，法官最终会命令你向债权人支付 110 亿美元，尽管你是素食主义者，而且你已经反复告诉大家你是多么有道德。我不知道为什么班克曼·弗里德的律师坚持认为他的素食主义是他不应该因为历史上最大的金融犯罪之一而入狱的原因，该犯罪有数千名受害者，但他们确实认为成为素食主义者会让你道德高尚。我所认识的最糟糕的人是素食主义者。我认识的一些最好的人都是素食主义者。纯素食主义不是道德决定者，山姆。

The point of all this is that for a business to function, you need two things:  
所有这一切的要点是，要使企业正常运转，您需要两件事：

A product. 一个产品。

Customers. 顾客。

Well, where do you get those?  
那么，你从哪里得到这些？

## When This Began 当这一切开始时

I had nothing to say. Poor quality control was resulting in bad things happening? That’s not really surprising. That’s the life cycle of a business in late-stage capitalism.  
我无话可说。质量控制不善导致了不好的事情发生？这并不奇怪。这就是晚期资本主义企业的生命周期。

Someone builds a business. They have a product and they have customers. That business makes money.  
有人创办一家企业。他们有产品，也有客户。那个生意赚钱。

Someone with more money, almost always disconnected from that specific business, goes “if I buy this business with all this capital I’ve got, it can essentially run itself and make me even more money. I gain more capital.”  
拥有更多资金的人几乎总是与该特定业务脱节，他说：“如果我用我拥有的所有资本购买这家企业，它基本上可以自行运行并为我赚更多的钱。我获得了更多的资本。”

At this stage, the businessman is thinking in businessman terms.  
在这个阶段，商人用商人的方式思考。

You know the phrase “buy low, sell high” being used to describe the stock market (the place that all these businessmen care about, even more than their businesses?). Another one is ‘maximize profits, cut costs.” Basically, these guys think in exactly _one way_, and it’s this:  
你知道“低买高卖”这句话被用来描述股票市场（所有这些商人都关心这个市场，甚至比他们的业务更关心？）。另一条是“利润最大化，削减成本”。基本上，这些人以一种方式思考，那就是：

![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/659x560,s7Ya4syCTwU_oVRjcK6HYdviBewlCjznbNBjwjFH4TZs/https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1318/1*kV7I-dAVBEQdho5McSa5jQ.png)

In a businessman’s head, you want to have few costs and maximum profit, so you lower the cost and raise the price, and as a result, you make record profits. It’s a very… childish way of looking at the world. I did not feel the need to concern myself with this, buuuuuut… then I got to thinking about it.  
在商人的头脑中，你希望成本很少，利润最大，所以你降低成本，提高价格，结果，你获得了创纪录的利润。这是一种非常……幼稚的看待世界的方式。我觉得没有必要关心这个，但是……然后我开始思考这个问题。

In our Uni Econ and Biz classes, teachers would explain to us things like “you can’t raise the prices too much or people won’t buy the product.” So there’s a limit to how much you can raise prices.  
在我们的 Uni Econ 和 Biz 课程中，老师会向我们解释诸如“你不能将价格提高太多，否则人们不会购买该产品”之类的事情。因此，您可以提高价格的幅度是有限的。

In a capitalist economy, the way this business is _supposed_ to work is that you start a company, you run it, and when you want to scale up, you either use your profits to do so (risky) or you have an investor put money into your company (now they are shouldering the risk with you).  
在资本主义经济中，这项业务的运作方式应该是你创办一家公司，你经营它，当你想扩大规模时，你要么用你的利润来这样做（有风险），要么让投资者投入资金进入你的公司（现在他们和你一起承担风险）。

From an investor’s angle, they want to put money into a company, then that company makes a profit, and then they make money as a result of putting that money into a company. You buy a share of it, and you expect that share price to increase from what it was previously.  
从投资者的角度来看，他们想把钱投入一家公司，然后该公司盈利，然后他们通过将钱投入一家公司而赚钱。您购买了该公司的股票，并且预计该股价将较之前上涨。

(there’s additional complexities to this, but that’s the general gist)  
（这还有额外的复杂性，但这是一般要点）

But, because time is linear, and human lives are not, an impossible request is implicitly made:  
但是，因为时间是线性的，而人的生命不是，所以隐含地提出了一个不可能的要求：

The share price must increase _infinitely._  
股价必须无限上涨。

The problem with this is that infinite value is not possible because there’s only _so much money_ in the economy. Thing is, since the company board’s responsibility is to deliver a return on the investment, the company becomes fixated on one thing and one thing only: costs.  
问题在于，无限价值是不可能的，因为经济中只有这么多钱。事实是，由于公司董事会的责任是提供投资回报，因此公司变得只关注一件事，而且只关注一件事：成本。

But you can only blow a balloon so big before it pops, and when that balloon pops, a lot of people suffer.  
但你只能在气球爆炸之前吹这么大的气球，而当气球爆炸时，很多人都会受苦。

So, these perverse motherfuckers modified the now-illegal Corporate Raider tactics of the 1980s into situations where they get a whole lot of money for doing very little, invariably destroying a great deal of value while extracting as much as they can out of it.  
因此，这些反常的混蛋们修改了 20 世纪 80 年代现已非法的企业掠夺者策略，让他们几乎不做事就获得大量金钱，总是破坏大量价值，同时尽可能多地从中获取利益。

They’re fracking the economy, in other words, and the only thing coming out of it is a great deal of suffering. The people who are doing _well_ are so irrelevant that in data science, we’d call them statistically insignificant outliers.  
换句话说，他们正在破坏经济，而唯一带来的就是巨大的痛苦。表现好的人是如此无关紧要，以至于在数据科学中，我们称他们为统计上不显着的异常值。

But those outliers are the problem. Because of them and the extractive system they support, all of us live worse lives, with less innovative tech than ever before, because they’re chasing after a goal that’s impossible because they’re operating in a system that was so poorly designed, no one thought to ask “well, infinite growth isn’t possible, so… what do you do?”  
但这些异常值才是问题所在。由于他们和他们支持的采掘系统，我们所有人的生活都变得更糟，创新技术比以往任何时候都少，因为他们正在追逐一个不可能的目标，因为他们在一个设计如此糟糕的系统中运行，没有一个想法是问“好吧，无限增长是不可能的，所以……你会做什么？”

A profitable business that makes products people want, like [Pyrex or Instant Pot](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/instant-pot-pyrex-parent-company-files-bankruptcy-vows-continue-sales-rcna89136) or [Toys R’ Us](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/toys-r-us-bankruptcy-private-equity/561758/), gets completely fucked because a bunch of thieves and pirates extracted what they could from the company, like it was a bank vault they could legally plunder, destroying the business, and moving on.  
一个生产人们想要的产品的盈利企业，比如派热克斯玻璃（Pyrex）、速溶锅（Instant Pot）或玩具反斗城（Toys R' Us），却被彻底搞砸了，因为一群小偷和海盗从公司榨取了他们能得到的东西，就像他们可以合法掠夺、摧毁一个银行金库一样。业务，并继续前进。

Value is being _removed_ from the economy.  
价值正在从经济中消失。

But you probably know this part already. This is important setup, but it’s also the most obvious stuff. I write my articles with the assumption that you, reading this, are a neurosurgeon. You’re very, very smart, great at what you do, and probably an amazing person to chat with over dinner. As a smart, curious person, you want to know about this, but you may not be familiar with the jargon. So I do a lot of setup and case building in these pieces not because I think you’re dumb, but because I think you want to know this stuff and I know that dumping jargon on you is a stupid way to fucking do it.  
但你可能已经知道这一部分了。这是重要的设置，但也是最明显的东西。我写文章时假设正在阅读本文的您是一名神经外科医生。你非常非常聪明，很擅长你所做的事情，并且可能是一个在晚餐时聊天的好人。作为一个聪明、好奇的人，你想了解这一点，但你可能不熟悉这些术语。所以我在这些文章中做了很多设置和案例构建，不是因为我认为你很愚蠢，而是因为我认为你想知道这些东西，而且我知道向你倾倒行话是一种愚蠢的做法。

## Consuming, Confusing 消费、混乱

This lack of self control I fear is never-ending. A bunch of guys who have a very, very simplistic view of business take over a company. They say “cut costs, raise prices,” and then they fuck with the numbers as much as they can so that the stock market goes up.  
我担心这种缺乏自我控制的情况是永无止境的。一群对商业有着非常非常简单的看法的人接管了一家公司。他们说“削减成本，提高价格”，然后他们尽可能地修改数字，以便股市上涨。

These people are not in the business of running the businesses they _actually run_. Jimmy didn’t run _Boeing_, he ran a side game where he plays with numbers a lot and hopes that will increase the value of his company’s stock.  
这些人并不从事他们实际经营的业务。吉米并不经营波音公司，他经营的是一项副业，他经常玩弄数字，并希望这会增加公司股票的价值。

But Boeing is not a “stock market go up” company. Boeing is an airplane company. It exists to make vehicles that transport people and objects from one location to the other. People will _not_ buy Boeing’s products if those products kill hundreds of people at a time.  
但波音并不是一家“股市上涨”的公司。波音公司是一家飞机公司。它的存在是为了制造将人和物体从一个地点运送到另一个地点的车辆。如果波音的产品一次杀死数百人，人们就不会购买这些产品。

The stock value _comes from_ the fact that the company makes a product people _want_. End of discussion.  
股票价值来自于公司生产人们想要的产品这一事实。讨论完毕。

Sure, you can be like Elon Musk and attempt to use Twitter to drive up share prices until the SEC tells you they will fuck up your _entire life_ if you try that shit again, rather than, say, selling cars and not fucking it up with [bad leadership](https://revealnews.org/article/tesla-says-its-factory-is-safer-but-it-left-injuries-off-the-books/).  
当然，你可以像埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）一样，尝试使用 Twitter 来推高股价，直到 SEC 告诉你，如果你再尝试这种做法，他们会搞砸你的一生，而不是说，卖汽车而不搞砸它领导不好。

I mean, check [this shit](https://www.tumblr.com/numberonecatwinner/701567544684855296/elon-wyd) out:  
我的意思是，检查一下这个狗屎：

> Managing Elon was a huge part of the company culture. Even I, as a lowly intern, would hear people talking about it openly in meetings. People knew how to present ideas in a way that would resonate with him, they knew how to creatively reinterpret (or ignore) his many insane demands, and they even knew how to “stage manage” parts of the physical office space so that it would appeal to Elon.  
> 管理埃隆是公司文化的重要组成部分。就连我这个地位低下的实习生，也会在会议上听到人们公开谈论这件事。人们知道如何以与他产生共鸣的方式提出想法，他们知道如何创造性地重新解释（或忽略）他的许多疯狂要求，他们甚至知道如何“舞台管理”物理办公空间的某些部分，以便向埃隆呼吁。
> 
> The funniest example of “stage management” I can remember is this dude on the IT security team. He had a script running in a terminal on one of his monitors that would output random garbage, Matrix-style, so that it always looked like he was doing Important Computer Things to anyone who walked by his desk. Second funniest was all the people I saw playing WoW at their desks after \~5pm, who did it in the office just to give the appearance that they were working late.  
> 我记得的“阶段管理”最有趣的例子是 IT 安全团队的这个家伙。他在一台显示器的终端上运行一个脚本，该脚本会输出矩阵式的随机垃圾，因此对于走过他办公桌的任何人来说，他总是看起来像是在做重要的计算机事情。第二有趣的是我看到下午 5 点左右在办公桌上玩《魔兽世界》的人，他们在办公室玩魔兽世界只是为了让自己看起来工作到很晚。
> 
> People were willing to do that at SpaceX because Elon was giving them the money (and hype) to get into outer space, a mission people cared deeply about. The company also grew with and around Elon. There were layers of management between individual employees and Elon, and those managers were experienced managers _of_ Elon. Again, I cannot stress enough how much of the company culture was oriented around managing this one guy.  
> 人们愿意在 SpaceX 这样做，因为埃隆给了他们进入外太空的资金（和炒作），这是人们非常关心的一项任务。该公司也与埃隆一起成长并围绕埃隆成长。员工个人和埃隆之间存在层级管理，这些管理者都是埃隆经验丰富的管理者。再次强调，公司文化在很大程度上是围绕管理这个人展开的。

How much money could you save — how much money could you _make_ — if Elon Musk was relegated to the simple role of courting potential investors and nothing more? If actual engineers were in charge, doing the actual work? How much of a drain on the company’s ability to be profitable is Elon?  
如果埃隆·马斯克只扮演吸引潜在投资者的简单角色，仅此而已，你能省多少钱——你能赚多少钱？如果真正的工程师负责，做实际的工作？埃隆对公司盈利能力的消耗有多大？

When McNerney says he wants to get more ‘leadership’ and less ‘expertise,’ he’s not saying the company actually is directionless and needs better steering, he’s referring to _classes of people_. He’s saying he wants more managerial overhead, but less people to manage — less people to tell him what to do.  
当麦克纳尼说他想要获得更多的“领导力”和更少的“专业知识”时，他并不是说公司实际上没有方向并且需要更好的指导，他指的是不同的人。他说他想要更多的管理费用，但需要管理的人更少——告诉他该做什么的人更少。

**In other words, he wants his job to be easier.** 
**换句话说，他希望自己的工作变得更轻松。**

He wants to spend time doing the caveman-brained “fuck with the numbers to make value go up” bullshit. Anyone can do that. It’s not hard. There’s a reason why every smart person I know with an MBA considers their MBA worthless.  
他想花时间做那些穴居人头脑中的“他妈的数字让价值上涨”的废话。任何人都可以做到这一点。这并不难。我认识的每个拥有 MBA 学位的聪明人都认为他们的 MBA 毫无价值，这是有原因的。

Sure, if you’re a short-term thinking, selfish, greedy asshole, maybe you’ll get lucky and live out your days pretty wealthy. Or you’ll end up like Bankman-Fried and Holmes: in fuckin’ jail.  
当然，如果你是一个短视、自私、贪婪的混蛋，也许你会很幸运，过上富裕的日子。否则你最终会像班克曼-弗里德和福尔摩斯一样：在他妈的监狱里。

It’s a similar issue we’re facing in Hollywood — around 2008–2011, when the business types started taking over and thinking they could use sabermetrics (the movie Moneyball was about this) to make all their decisions.  
这是我们在好莱坞面临的类似问题——大约在 2008 年到 2011 年，当时商业类型开始接管并认为他们可以使用 Sabermetrics（电影《点球成金》就是关于这个的）来做出所有决定。

See, the thing about being a “leader” in reality, and not some delusional cloud cuckoo land for fucking MBA morons, is that you actually have to _lead_ people, and that’s the opposite of what fellas like David Zaslav do (he just deletes things to play money games for a merger that was stupid as shit and hurt the shareholders of both companies — this should have been enough for people to vote him the fuck out with some really, really strict penalties).  
看，在现实中成为“领导者”，而不是那些他妈的 MBA 白痴的妄想云杜鹃之地，是你实际上必须领导人们，而这与像大卫扎斯拉夫这样的人所做的相反（他只是删除了一些东西）为了合并而玩金钱游戏，这种合并愚蠢至极，伤害了两家公司的股东——这应该足以让人们投票让他滚蛋，并给予一些非常非常严格的处罚）。

Warner Brothers should make products that people want and then buy those products. Instead, HBO rebrands to Max (HBO was the brand that mattered, no one cares about ‘Max’), loses subscribers, tries to kill the properties people _actually go to HBO Max for,_ kills properties as tax writeoffs, tries to prioritize the shit that killed the Discovery Channel… like… at no point does the core business of _being fucking Warner Brothers_, a company with an infinitely valuable portfolio — actually seem to come up.  
华纳兄弟应该生产人们想要的产品，然后购买这些产品。相反，HBO 将品牌重新命名为 Max（HBO 是一个重要的品牌，没有人关心“Max”），失去了订户，试图消灭人们实际上去 HBO Max 购买的财产，消灭财产作为税收冲销，试图优先考虑这些狗屎这杀死了探索频道……就像……华纳兄弟这个拥有无限价值投资组合的公司的核心业务似乎从来没有真正出现过。

Instead, Zaslav is one of the pathetic losers who lost to a bunch of average fuckin’ joes last year when those people went on strike.  
相反，扎斯拉夫是可悲的失败者之一，去年当这些人罢工时，他输给了一群普通的混蛋。

At no point are these men actually providing _leadership_. They’re just in the leader _class_. They’re really no different than the Silicon Valley ‘founders’ that put a lot of value on ‘starting’ a company, whose entire business model is “the customers are idiots who invest in us and give us lots of money until the company collapses, we sell out, and we leave.”  
这些人在任何时候都没有真正发挥领导作用。他们只是领导阶层。他们实际上与硅谷的“创始人”没有什么不同，他们非常重视“创办”一家公司，他们的整个商业模式是“客户都是白痴，他们投资我们，给我们很多钱，直到公司倒闭” ，我们卖完，然后离开。”

Hell, Zaslav is a weird creep who doesn’t even understand his own product. He comes off as a fucking loser even in [an article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/david-zaslav-is-angling-to-become-americas-king-of-content) that’s clearly public relations puff to try and make him seem like he isn’t a greedy creep who sucks at his job.  
天哪，扎斯拉夫是个奇怪的怪物，他甚至不了解自己的产品。即使在一篇明显是公关吹捧的文章中，他也表现得像个该死的失败者，试图让他看起来不是一个贪婪的、不擅长工作的怪人。

> In July 2019, the Zaslavs were on Geffen’s yacht, sailing around the Mediterranean with a crew that included Winfrey, King, and Lloyd and Laura Jacobs Blankfein. One night, they decided to screen the award-winning BBC comedy _Fleabag,_ which was made by a production company that Discovery now owns but which Zaslav hadn’t gotten around to watching. A minute into the first episode, the group found itself in the midst of a hot and heavy sex scene. Pause! “So I put my hand up,” recalls Zaslav. “I go, _whoa_! So they stop it. And I said, ‘Okay, here’s the strategy. We either shut it off, or we put it back on and everybody only looks forward. We don’t look at each other until it’s over.’ ” (They opted for the latter.)  
> 2019 年 7 月，扎斯拉夫夫妇乘坐格芬的游艇，与温弗瑞、金、劳埃德和劳拉·雅各布斯·布兰克梵 (Laura Jacobs Blankfein) 等船员一起绕地中海航行。一天晚上，他们决定放映屡获殊荣的 BBC 喜剧《伦敦生活》，该片是由 Discovery 旗下的一家制作公司制作的，但扎斯拉夫没有抽出时间观看。第一集刚开始一分钟，大家就发现自己处于火热而沉重的性爱场景之中。暂停！ “所以我举起了手，”扎斯拉夫回忆道。 “我去，哇！所以他们阻止了。我说，‘好吧，这就是策略。我们要么把它关掉，要么把它重新打开，每个人都只能期待。我们不会互相看对方，直到一切结束。’”（他们选择了后者。）

In fact, they’re [thin-skinned morons](https://deadline.com/2023/08/hollywood-ceo-meeting-writers-strike-1235529614/) who [draw jeers](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-boss-david-190417809.html?guccounter=1) and who lost a brutal PR battle and were genuinely shocked that nobody fucking likes them because they’re inept leaders. A real leader has his finger on the pulse of his people. A fucking incompetent shitsack is the one who’s taken by surprise. _Everyone_ thinks they’re incompetent. No one with any serious understanding of this business thinks these people are good at their jobs.  
事实上，他们是一群脸皮薄的白痴，引来嘲笑，在一场残酷的公关战中失败，他们真正感到震惊的是，没有人喜欢他们，因为他们是无能的领导者。真正的领导者能够把握人民的脉搏。一个他妈的无能的混蛋才会被吓到。每个人都认为自己无能。任何对这一行业有认真了解的人都不会认为这些人擅长他们的工作。

In fact, the shareholders are starting to take notice, which may result in [punishing Zaslav](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/warner-bros-discovery-bosss-payday-is-toast-2023-11-27/) heavily as Warner Bros.’ stock continues to decline.  
事实上，股东们已经开始注意到这一点，随着华纳兄弟的股价持续下跌，这可能会导致扎斯拉夫受到严厉惩罚。

And yet… 但是…

They have aspirations of being Steve Jobs, but Steve Jobs, for all his bullshit, was obsessed with making products that actually _worked_ and selling them to people who _wanted_ them.  
他们渴望成为史蒂夫·乔布斯，但史蒂夫·乔布斯尽管胡说八道，却痴迷于制造真正有用的产品并将其出售给需要它们的人。

It’s telling, I think, that while a lot of modern business types I’ve spoken with, read interviews with, whatever, have obsessions with being Steve Jobs and the _fantasy_ that being Steve Jobs provides, his biopic only made $4.4 million dollars, because nobody actually gives a shit about Steve Jobs, they just want to be as successful as he was.  
我认为，这很能说明问题，尽管我曾与许多现代商业人士交谈过、读过采访等等，他们都痴迷于成为史蒂夫·乔布斯以及成为史蒂夫·乔布斯所带来的幻想，但他的传记片只赚了 440 万美元，因为没有人真正关心史蒂夫·乔布斯，他们只是想像他一样成功。

![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/700x560,sITmG4bU32Yw0S-VCmO0HCW3qOlviL6MGkjyjwiq3_k0/https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*qO98zxX3_ywg7SeU.jpg)

Steve Jobs made Apple one of the biggest companies in the _entire world_ by making sure that his devices were pleasing and easy to use, were must-have lifestyle products, and he catered, very heavily, _to artists._  
史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）确保他的设备令人愉悦且易于使用，成为必备的生活方式产品，并且他非常迎合艺术家，从而使苹果公司成为全世界最大的公司之一。

In fact, as the new boss, Tim Apple, as they call him, has pushed Apple towards being a luxury brand, Apple has begun to falter, finding itself embroiled in regulatory discourse (because rather than innovating on making valuable products, they’re trying to innovate on ‘new and exciting ways to create literal garbage by forcing you to constantly buy new shit’ with things like proprietary cables and non-replaceable parts). Apple users never really had respect (because no one respects a person for simply buying a product advertised to them), but Apple users are now _actively_ disrespected for buying stupid, moronic shit like a $3500 VR headset that kind of sucks ass and is [massively embarrassing](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/apple-vision-pro-users-dumb-stunts-social-media-1234961685/).  
事实上，随着新老板蒂姆·苹果（他们这样称呼他）推动苹果成为一个奢侈品牌，苹果已经开始动摇，发现自己卷入了监管讨论（因为他们没有在制造有价值的产品上进行创新，而是在制造有价值的产品上进行创新）。试图创新“新的、令人兴奋的方式来制造真正的垃圾，迫使你不断地购买新的东西，比如专有电缆和不可更换的零件”）。苹果用户从来没有真正得到过尊重（因为没有人会因为一个人仅仅购买了向他们做广告的产品而尊重他们），但苹果用户现在却因为购买了像 3500 美元的 VR 耳机这样愚蠢、愚蠢的东西而受到极大的不尊重，这种东西很糟糕，而且非常尴尬。 。

Apple was better when it was focused on making things people actually wanted. While its stock is going up, its profile is beginning to crumble, and every single time that happens, _the stock follows_.  
当苹果专注于制造人们真正想要的东西时，它会变得更好。当它的股价上涨时，它的形象却开始崩溃，而每次这种情况发生时，股价都会随之下跌。

The executive class talks a big game about leadership and innovation and all of this goddamn shit. Bob Iger claims that his movies are suffering because of [_not enough executive control_](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/disney-ceo-reveals-thinks-marvels-bombed-box-office-rcna127254).  
高管阶层谈论了一场关于领导力和创新以及所有这些该死的狗屎的大游戏。鲍勃·艾格声称，由于没有足够的执行控制力，他的电影受到了影响。

> …there wasn’t as much supervision on the set … where we have executives there really looking over what’s being done.  
> ……片场没有那么多的监督……我们有高管真正监督正在做的事情。

He further argues against people who actually know how to do the job doing the job, [saying](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/disney-ceo-bob-iger-says-movies-have-been-too-focused-on-messaging.html):  
他进一步反对那些真正知道如何做这项工作的人，他说：

> Creators lost sight of what their №1 objective needed to be  
> 创作者忽视了他们的第一目标是什么

I get it, you’re butthurt about losing your own personal Vietnam, dude, but you do not have a right to speak, not when…  
我明白了，你因为失去自己的越南而感到愤怒，伙计，但你没有发言权，除非……

> Feedback on dailies and sequences comes from all over the place, including executives and producers that aren’t in explicitly creative roles, H said. “I’ve had entire sequences get blasted apart by someone who shouldn’t even be a part of the feedback process. Like, why do you get an opinion on this?”  
> H 说，关于样片和序列的反馈来自各地，包括不担任明确创意角色的高管和制片人。 “我曾经历过整个序列被一个不应该参与反馈过程的人炸毁的情况。比如，你为什么对此有意见？”
> 
> Sam’s had similar experiences. “You get producers that say, ‘I want to be involved in the artistic process,’ and you’re like–” he makes a skeptical noise, “I don’t ask to look at your spreadsheets, man.”  
> 萨姆也有类似的经历。 “制作人会说，‘我想参与艺术创作过程’，然后你就会——”他发出怀疑的声音，“我不会要求看你的电子表格，伙计。”

Read enough about Disney, especially Marvel, and a recurring theme keeps coming up: execs come in, demand lots of changes that are stupid, time-wasting, and [make no sense](https://www.vulture.com/2023/01/inside-the-vfx-union-brewing-in-hollywood.html?utm%5Fmedium=s1&utm%5Fsource=tw&utm%5Fcampaign=vulture).  
读够了有关迪士尼，尤其是漫威的内容后，就会不断出现一个反复出现的主题：高管进来后，要求做出大量改变，这些改变是愚蠢的、浪费时间的、毫无意义的。

> They don’t figure stuff out early enough. So they rewrite, redo, and fumble in the dark for a long time while we are doing the VFX.” This animator recalled a whole portion of an action sequence that hadn’t been storyboarded before postproduction. “It was just, ‘This hero avoids many things for this amount of time.’ Everything was blank. Basically, the studio said to the VFX artists, ‘Figure it out. Make it look cool.’ They had no idea what they wanted to do. Since the movies work so well, people think, _Oh, well that’s the way to do it_. That’s the hard part. There’s a better way that’s less stressful on the artist and less expensive for sure.  
> 他们没有及早弄清楚事情。因此，当我们进行视觉特效时，他们会重写、重做并在黑暗中摸索很长一段时间。”这位动画师回忆起在后期制作之前没有制作故事板的动作序列的整个部分。 “只是，‘这位英雄在这段时间内避免了很多事情。’一切都是空白。基本上，工作室对视觉特效艺术家说，‘想办法。让它看起来很酷。”他们不知道自己想做什么。由于电影的效果非常好，人们会想，哦，那就这样吧。这是最困难的部分。有一种更好的方法，可以减轻艺术家的压力，而且成本也更低。

We’re getting stupid reshoots and fucked-up planning because of this shit. I know of an executive note that once expressed confusion that one character was larger than another. This was because the executive did not understand that objects closer to the camera appear bigger than objects further away. These are not exactly the brightest bulbs in the box.  
因为这件事，我们得到了愚蠢的重拍和糟糕的计划。我知道一份执行说明曾经表达了对一个角色比另一个角色大的困惑。这是因为这位高管不明白距离相机较近的物体看起来比距离较远的物体更大。这些并不是盒子里最亮的灯泡。

These people don’t even suffer the consequences as much as they should. For instance, Victoria Alonso was [singled out](https://twitter.com/%5F%5Fchrislee/status/1637943581490180096?s=46&t=IY97o910kzGDMKcPFvwyjA) as a massive reason why Marvel’s production pipeline was so toxic. She got fired, not for making Marvel less money than ever, not for harming countless lives, but for breaking her contract with Disney by advocating for a project over at Amazon that she was trying to build her own brand on.  
这些人甚至没有承受应有的后果。例如，维多利亚·阿隆索被认为是漫威制作流程如此有毒的一个重要原因。她被解雇，不是因为让漫威赚的钱比以往任何时候都少，也不是因为伤害了无数人的生命，而是因为她在亚马逊倡导一个她试图建立自己品牌的项目，从而违反了与迪士尼的合同。

![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/700x776,suMPHZ1Y5oRHYu2Oe9DF7mkTMev71SmUIJxgKrSaE-nA/https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*VE3ZY8eiPMRocTZGL6ONHA.png)

While Bob Iger and his friends were taking vacations for months at a time (not working or doing anything of value) and talking about how the industry needs _more_ executives, he was _losing his shareholders money_ by insisting on not ceding to the demands of people to be paid fairly, while he himself was massively overvalued considering that he really only diminished Disney’s value, as opposed to growing it.  
当鲍勃·艾格和他的朋友们一次休假数月（不工作或做任何有价值的事情）并谈论行业如何需要更多高管时，他坚持不屈服于人们的要求，从而损失了股东的钱。获得公平的报酬，而他本人则被严重高估，因为他实际上只是削弱了迪士尼的价值，而不是增加了它的价值。

Bob Iger’s own ego meant he couldn’t even do his _actual_ job of making shareholder value go up, much less his _ostensible_ job of running Disney. This is a man who isn’t just not valuable to Disney; this is a man who actively harms its value, a man so disconnected from reality that he’s described as _shocked_ that people don’t like him when he says “we’ll never pay you fairly.”  
鲍勃·艾格的自负意味着他甚至无法完成提高股东价值的实际工作，更不用说他表面上经营迪士尼的工作了。这个人不仅对迪士尼没有价值，而且对迪士尼来说毫无价值。这是一个积极损害其价值的人，一个与现实如此脱节的人，以至于当他说“我们永远不会公平地支付你”时，他对人们不喜欢他感到震惊。

I had a boss once who threatened to fire me because I stayed working late to help a teacher get some work done at the teacher’s request. I cost them nothing. There was a worry that their insurance might not cover me if I got hurt somehow while photocopying syllabi.  
我曾经有一个老板威胁要解雇我，因为我按照老师的要求加班到很晚，以帮助老师完成一些工作。我没有花费他们任何钱。有人担心如果我在复印教学大纲时受到某种伤害，他们的保险可能不会覆盖我。

Meanwhile, dipshits like Bob Iger costs his company billions. Seems like he shouldn’t just get the boot, but people should be doing everything they can to tear him apart. If he was actually smart, he’d shut the fuck up, cut back as much managerial oversight, and let people who know their shit do their actual fucking shit.  
与此同时，像鲍勃·艾格这样的蠢货让他的公司损失了数十亿美元。看起来他不应该只是被踢，但人们应该想尽办法把他撕碎。如果他真的很聪明，他就会闭嘴，减少尽可能多的管理监督，让那些知道自己的狗屎的人做他们真正的狗屎。

Why the fuck does he still have a job? He can’t get the shareholders what they want. That much is plain. Instead, he’s out there trying to threaten writers with “we will crush you and you won’t have a home by Christmas” while losing worse than America did in Vietnam.  
他妈的为什么还有工作？他无法让股东得到他们想要的东西。这很简单。相反，他试图威胁作家们“我们会压垮你们，到圣诞节你们就没有家了”，而他的失败比美国在越南的失败还要严重。

Which is really funny, because, you see… all these stupid motherfuckers keep falling prey to the exact thing that cost America Vietnam: The McNamara Fallacy.  
这真的很有趣，因为，你看……所有这些愚蠢的混蛋不断成为美国越南损失惨重的牺牲品：麦克纳马拉谬误。

_Hey, I could use some help with medical bills and groceries. If you want to support the work I do, like_ [_this article_](https://docseuss.medium.com/lore-is-a-trap-and-will-kill-your-story-if-you-let-it-so-what-can-we-do-about-it-9f84850980e3) _about the biggest pitfall young writers face and how to get around it, then hey, hit up my tip jar._  
嘿，我需要一些医疗费和杂货费方面的帮助。如果你想支持我所做的工作，喜欢这篇关于年轻作家面临的最大陷阱以及如何绕过它的文章，那么嘿，打开我的小费罐。

_I figure this kind of writing helps inexperienced writers the most — which means people who might not have the finances to afford my work if I kept it behind a paywall. A paywall would help me, obviously — I could guarantee a certain minimum that would ensure my ability to continue writing these articles — but the people who need my help the most cannot afford it. So I gotta rattle the tip jar. I know it’s not pleasant, but like… think of me like a busker. I’d rather play a song on the street and get a few coins in a hat than just run a gofundme or something._ 
_我认为这种写作对缺乏经验的作家最有帮助——这意味着如果我把作品放在付费墙后面，他们可能没有财力负担我的作品。显然，付费墙会对我有所帮助——我可以保证一定的最低限度，以确保我有能力继续写这些文章——但最需要我帮助的人却负担不起。所以我得把小费罐弄得嘎嘎作响。我知道这并不令人愉快，但就像……把我想象成一个街头艺人。我宁愿在街上播放一首歌，然后在帽子里得到一些硬币，也不愿只是经营一个 gofundme 之类的东西。_

_I, personally, can only do this with your support; if I wasn’t doing this, I’d have to get a second job, and as disabled as I am, that’s really not great. I have to spend between $145 and up to an entire Nintendo Switch’s worth of my income on medical care every two weeks. Seriously, it was $300 not too long ago. That’s an extremely difficult burden for me._ 
_我个人只有在你们的支持下才能做到这一点；如果我不这样做，我就必须找到第二份工作，而像我这样的残疾人，这真的不太好。每两周我必须花费 145 美元到相当于我整个 Nintendo Switch 收入的医疗费用。说实话，不久前还是 300 美元。这对我来说是一个极其困难的负担。_

_So it’s either do this or get a second job, and a second job would not be ideal given my current disability. So when you send me a tip, you’re not just helping a disabled writer like me, you’re helping tons of students, disabled people, and others without access. Thank you._ 
_因此，要么这样做，要么找第二份工作，鉴于我目前的残疾，第二份工作并不理想。因此，当您向我发送提示时，您不仅仅是在帮助像我这样的残疾作家，您还在帮助大量的学生、残疾人和其他无法访问的人。谢谢。_

## I wanna know the answers.  
我想知道答案。

No more lies, executive class. I’m tired of hearing about how the world would be better if it were possible to give you more control than you already have. You’re at 100%, and the world is worse than ever before, to the point where you’re noticing it and calling your own problems “[a full-scale depression](https://deadline.com/2024/03/hollywood-job-losses-executives-full-scale-depression-1235841674/).” You want to be essential by putting yourself in everyone’s path, but instead, you’re just in the way.  
别再撒谎了，高管阶层。我厌倦了听到有关如果能够给予你比现有更多的控制权的话世界会变得更好的说法。你处于 100% 状态，世界比以往任何时候都更糟糕，以至于你注意到了这一点，并将你自己的问题称为“全面的抑郁症”。你想让自己成为每个人的必经之路，但事实恰恰相反，你只是碍事。

Let me tell you a story.  
让我给你讲一个故事。

There’s a businessman, we’ll call him, uh, I don’t know, David-Bob Zaslav Iger, who’s been hired to run a farm. “Alright,” he says, “well, I’m going to maximize profits.” How does he do that? Well, he looks at the data. Data, after all, is scientific, right?  
有一个商人，我们称他为，呃，我不知道，大卫·鲍勃·扎斯拉夫·艾格，他被雇来经营一家农场。 “好吧，”他说，“好吧，我要实现利润最大化。”他是怎么做到的？嗯，他看数据。毕竟，数据是科学的，对吗？

And Davey-Bobby here, he sees that people _love_ buying soybeans. Last year, well, that’s what they made a lot of profit doing.  
戴维-鲍比在这里，他看到人们喜欢购买大豆。去年，他们就靠这个赚了很多钱。

He looks out at the field and notices that one of them is currently not being used. “Well,” he says, “let’s plant some soybeans in that.” Then he says he’s gonna dig up the other fields, trick the government into giving them money by calling it a tax writeoff, and making some more soybeans over there too.  
他朝田野望去，发现其中一个目前尚未使用。 “好吧，”他说，“我们在里面种一些大豆吧。”然后他说他要挖其他地，欺骗政府给他们钱，称之为税收冲销，并在那里生产更多的大豆。

Seems like a good idea, right? People show they want soybeans, and they don’t show that they want the other stuff, and why would you let one of your fields lie fallow like that? They should all be making soybeans all the time, since that makes them the most profit.  
看起来是个好主意，对吧？人们表现出他们想要大豆，但他们没有表现出他们想要其他东西，为什么你会让你的一块田像这样休耕呢？他们应该一直生产大豆，因为这使他们获得最大的利润。

Well, Robert McNamara thought the same thing. If he could make everything data-driven and scientific, it’d help the United States win the Vietnam war.  
罗伯特·麦克纳马拉也有同样的想法。如果他能让一切变得数据驱动和科学化，这将有助于美国赢得越南战争。

> But when the McNamara discipline is applied too literally, the first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. The second step is to disregard that which can’t easily be measured or given a quantitative value. The third step is to presume that what can’t be measured easily really isn’t important. The fo\[u\]rth step is to say that what can’t be easily measured really doesn’t exist. This is suicide.  
> 但是，当麦克纳马拉法则被过于字面地应用时，第一步就是测量任何可以轻松测量的东西。第二步是忽略那些不容易测量或给出定量值的东西。第三步是假设那些无法轻易衡量的东西实际上并不重要。第四步是说那些无法轻易测量的东西实际上并不存在。这是自杀。

If you want to lose the Vietnam war, the first thing you do is discard what cannot be _easily measured._  
如果你想输掉越南战争，你要做的第一件事就是放弃那些无法轻易衡量的东西。

As you may note, the United States did not win. Nor did it win in Afghanistan and Iraq when Donald Rumsfeld tried the same thing in the early 2000s.  
正如您可能注意到的，美国没有获胜。当唐纳德·拉姆斯菲尔德 (Donald Rumsfeld) 在 2000 年代初尝试同样的事情时，它也没有在阿富汗和伊拉克取得胜利。

Why is that? Shouldn’t data help you make _better decisions_?  
这是为什么？数据不应该帮助您做出更好的决策吗？

Well, there’s the obvious problem: Bungie, for instance, is an obsessively data-focused company. They make a lot of decisions based on data. I, for my part, am an expert in the field of making games. Bungie made a _lot of mistakes_ when it came to the data, and you can see player dips after a lot of them.  
嗯，有一个明显的问题：例如，Bungie 是一家痴迷于数据的公司。他们根据数据做出很多决定。就我而言，我是游戏制作领域的专家。 Bungie 在数据方面犯了很多错误，你可以看到玩家在犯了很多错误之后出现了下滑。

For instance, there was a time when they decided players were picking one grenade too much, and they wanted players to pick the other grenades the same rate (why? because they decided, with absolutely no reasoning, that using something ‘too much’ meant it was strong, saying:  
例如，曾经有一段时间，他们认为玩家过多地选择了一种手榴弹，并且希望玩家以相同的速度选择其他手榴弹（为什么？因为他们毫无理由地认为，使用“太多”的东西意味着它很强烈，说：

> The Tripmine Grenade has been a dominant grenade choice for a while. It’s possible that this because it was the grenade that did everything: set a trap, stick it to an opponent, miss an opponent and end up setting a trap anyway. The original intent with this grenade was to be used as a trap, not a sticky, so we moved it back in that direction.  
> 一段时间以来，绊雷手榴弹一直是主要的手榴弹选择。这可能是因为手榴弹做了一切：设置陷阱，将其粘在对手身上，错过对手，最后还是设置了陷阱。这个手榴弹的最初目的是用作陷阱，而不是粘性物体，所以我们把它移回了那个方向。

“it’s possible.” They didn’t know _why_ it was popular (it’s fun, has good hit feedback, and is the only grenade that seems to actually do much — the others are less exciting and not nearly as fun to use), so they decided it must be too strong and good at everything, so it needed to be nerfed. Rather than asking if the other grenades sucked, they just assumed strength, so it got a nerf. The game got worse for no real reason.  
“这是可能的。”他们不知道为什么它如此受欢迎（它很有趣，具有良好的命中反馈，而且是唯一看起来确实能做很多事情的手榴弹 - 其他的手榴弹不那么令人兴奋，而且使用起来也没有那么有趣），所以他们认为它一定是太强了，什么都擅长，所以需要削弱。他们没有问其他手榴弹是否糟糕，而是假设了力量，所以它得到了削弱。比赛无缘无故地变得更糟。

The explicit, specific fun of that grenade was “unicorning,” where you throw it in a group of enemies, it sticks on a guy, he runs around, you watch it count down, and boom! It blows up. You know, one of the most fun things about the series that made Bungie big in the first place: Halo. It was just like Halo’s plasma grenade!  
那枚手榴弹的明确、具体的乐趣是“独角兽”，你把它扔到一群敌人中，它粘在一个人身上，他跑来跑去，你看着它倒计时，然后轰隆隆！它爆炸了。你知道，这个系列中最有趣的事情之一就是让 Bungie 变得如此伟大：光环。就像光环的等离子手雷一样！

This was far from the only time Bungie would fuck this up; any time something became popular or interesting, it got a nerf. People would find the next most fun thing, and it’d get nerfed too. Bungie made so many decisions based on data, and look where they are now. [They’re on track for a 45% revenue miss](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/11/01/the-bungie-and-destiny-2-situation-gets-worse-per-new-info/?sh=3e20fc30140d). Marathon isn’t just delayed, its director was replaced with a guy trying to turn it into a hero shooter, a failed-genre dominated by… well, basically just dead games these days. But, hey, it’s better than the previous Marathon pitch, at least. The upcoming expansion is in bad shape too.  
这可不是 Bungie 唯一一次把事情搞砸的。每当某件事变得流行或有趣时，它就会被削弱。人们会找到下一个最有趣的事情，但它也会被削弱。 Bungie 根据数据做出了很多决定，看看它们现在在哪里。他们的收入预计将下降 45%。 《马拉松》不仅被推迟了，它的导演也被一个试图把它变成英雄射击游戏的人所取代，这是一种失败的类型，主要是……好吧，现在基本上只是死游戏。但是，嘿，这至少比之前的马拉松比赛要好。即将到来的扩张也状况不佳。

Now, not to toot my own horn, but a while back, after Destiny 2 came out to crushingly-bad player response, I wrote a [two articles](https://web.archive.org/web/20180301154302/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/how-destiny-2-failed-its-fanbase-analysis) for the now-defunct USGamer [about Destiny](https://web.archive.org/web/20220811230639/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/how-destiny-2-can-win-us-back). In these articles, I laid out what Bungie would need to do to succeed. When Forsaken released, wouldn’t you know it, Bungie did about 9 out of 10 things I asked them to do — though I’m sure they didn’t read my articles and make decisions based on that.  
现在，我并不是要自吹自擂，而是不久前，在《命运 2》推出后，玩家反应极其糟糕，我为现已不复存在的 USGamer 写了两篇关于《命运》的文章。在这些文章中，我列出了 Bungie 需要做什么才能取得成功。当《遗落之族》发行时，你难道不知道吗，Bungie 做了我要求他们做的十分之九的事情——尽管我确信他们没有阅读我的文章并据此做出决定。

I’ve written [about Destiny](https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5xkgw/why-destiny-2-isnt-working-and-how-to-fix-it) since then. And [again](https://docseuss.medium.com/the-last-one-about-destiny-46e209c6dc77). And [again](https://docseuss.medium.com/the-one-after-the-last-one-about-destiny-cbbf2a4f1100). Big Youtubers sent their fans my way, angrily telling me Bungie could do no wrong, but in the end, I ended up being proven correct.  
从那时起我就开始写关于命运的文章。然后再次。然后再次。大Youtuber们向我推荐了他们的粉丝，愤怒地告诉我Bungie不会做错事，但最终，我最终被证明是正确的。

Bungie, notoriously data-driven, keeps making decisions designed to keep players around while losing players. Me, notoriously research-driven, offered advice, and when they took actions that lined up with my advice (because, again, I do not have any evidence that they used me as a resource, only that when their decisions matched my unsolicited advice, they did well), and when they did not, they did poorly.  
Bungie 是出了名的数据驱动型公司，它不断做出旨在留住玩家的决策，同时又会失去玩家。我，出了名的以研究为导向，提供了建议，当他们采取与我的建议一致的行动时（因为，再次，我没有任何证据表明他们使用我作为资源，只有当他们的决定与我主动提出的建议相匹配时，他们做得很好），而当他们做得不好时，他们就做得很差。

You see, a guy running a farm, like Davey-Bobby, looks at the data and thinks he sees the full picture. The problem is, he hasn’t got the expertise.  
你看，一个经营农场的人，比如戴维-鲍比，查看数据并认为他看到了全貌。问题是，他没有专业知识。

I often talk about that [one-paragraph short story](https://kwarc.info/teaching/TDM/Borges.pdf) by Borges, the one where they made the most accurate map of the world, because as it turned out, a map like that would be useless because, in being so accurate, it must necessarily be the exact same size as the world it covers, making it impossible to be read or followed.  
我经常谈论博尔赫斯的那篇短篇小说，他们在其中绘制了最精确的世界地图，因为事实证明，这样的地图毫无用处，因为要如此精确，它必然是与它所覆盖的世界大小完全相同，使其无法被阅读或跟随。

It is difficult to compress all the data you have into a map that is perfect, so you must rely on people to fill in the blanks. You know, _expertise_, the thing that mister Jimmy “at my direction, my company killed more people than Oklahoma City” McNerney of the Boeing company so vociferously rejected. We’re talking about a man who literally had an enemies list and it was all safety inspectors level of cartoon stupidity here.  
将你拥有的所有数据压缩成一张完美的地图是很困难的，所以你必须依靠人们来填补空白。你知道，专业知识，波音公司的吉米先生“在我的指导下，我的公司杀死的人比俄克拉荷马城还多”，麦克纳尼如此强烈地拒绝了这一点。我们谈论的是一个真正有敌人名单的人，这都是安全检查员级别的卡通愚蠢。

So, if you were running a farm and decided to “make total use of our resources,” what you’d find is that, oh, maybe people don’t want soybeans that much — you didn’t see the whole picture — or maybe you’d find that a pest that likes soybeans eats all your crops. Or, worse yet, you’d find that none of your fields are growing _because you didn’t let them lie fallow_.  
所以，如果你经营一个农场并决定“充分利用我们的资源”，你会发现，哦，也许人们不太想要大豆——你没有看到全貌——或者也许你会发现一种喜欢大豆的害虫吃掉了你所有的庄稼。或者，更糟糕的是，你会发现你的田地都没有生长，因为你没有让它们休耕。

You see, one of the most important things, which is true of both plants and people, is that you’ve got to let them lie fallow for a while. A field cannot support the same crop forever. You must _intentionally_ let the field lie empty, producing nothing… because fields are more like batteries. A field ‘charges up’ with nitrogen and other nutrients, and then, when it’s ready, you begin using it by planting crops in it. When you’ve used it up, you let it lie fallow, let it _rest_, and _then_ you come back to it.  
你看，最重要的事情之一，对植物和人来说都是如此，就是你必须让它们闲置一段时间。一块田地不可能永远种植同样的作物。你必须故意让田地空着，不产生任何东西……因为田地更像电池。一块田地“充满”了氮和其他养分，然后，当它准备好时，你就可以开始在其中种植农作物来使用它。当你用完它后，你让它闲置，让它休息，然后你再回来使用它。

People are the exact same way.  
人们都是一样的。

## A constant wave of tension  
持续的紧张情绪

On top of broken trust, these fuckers see their brands as properties to be leveraged. “If people like superhero movies now, they’ll like superhero movies forever!” Instead, what we’re seeing is that people get tired and they abandon these brands, because brands are not property with value that goes up forever. Brands are fields that must lie fallow.  
除了失去信任之外，这些混蛋还将他们的品牌视为可以利用的财产。 “如果人们现在喜欢超级英雄电影，他们就会永远喜欢超级英雄电影！”相反，我们看到的是人们感到疲倦并放弃了这些品牌，因为品牌并不是具有永远增值的财产。品牌是必须休耕的领域。

For a while, everyone wanted to make cowboy movies. Then they wanted to make war movies. Then detective movies. Eventually, by the 80s, they wanted to make Star Wars copies, because they were chasing trends, but very few of them actually found the success that Star Wars had. I mean, look, I love The Black Hole, but that was no Star Wars, you know?  
有一段时间，每个人都想拍牛仔电影。然后他们想拍战争电影。然后是侦探片。最终，到了 80 年代，他们想要制作《星球大战》的副本，因为他们在追逐潮流，但很少有人真正获得《星球大战》所取得的成功。我的意思是，听着，我喜欢《黑洞》，但这不是《星球大战》，你知道吗？

To get the most out of a property, you don’t salt the earth with it — that’ll just kill your fields (the market). You be smart, like George Lucas was. He made three good Star Wars movies, then slowed it down. He let culture handle it — posted low-profile merchandise and books and expanded universe content that only the hardest of the hard core would care about, and then, fifteen years later, he brought Star Wars back, and it was _huge_.  
为了充分利用一处房产，你不能用它在土地上撒盐——那只会毁掉你的田地（市场）。你要聪明，就像乔治·卢卡斯那样。他拍了三部出色的星球大战电影，然后放慢了速度。他让文化来处理这件事——发布低调的商品和书籍，以及只有最硬核的人才会关心的扩展的宇宙内容，然后，十五年后，他带回了《星球大战》，而且规模巨大。

Then he let it lie fallow again, sold it to Disney, and they immediately brought it back, again, about fifteen years later. It didn’t do so great because Disney froze it in time, but that’s a bit of a different issue, not really relevant to the current article.  
然后他又让它闲置，卖给迪士尼，大约十五年后，他们立即将它带回来。它的表现不太好，因为迪士尼及时冻结了它，但这是一个不同的问题，与当前的文章并不真正相关。

_but, since it’s interesting, here’s the brief idea: JJ Abrams made something that more or less copied the older movies. It was deliberately designed ‘for the fans.’ We can see this with the other unsuccessful side movie, Solo, which literally tells us why he’s called Han Solo and where he got his blaster from and everything else, and we can see this with Rise of Skywalker. Lucas’ success was because he was making something new every time. And that’s why the most successful Star Wars movie Disney made was, yes, The Last Jedi, which was fucking_ huge _on home video by an obscene degree. Some jerks on the internet got mad (and were buying bots to leave negative reviews on Rotten Tomatoes lol) but in reality, The Last Jedi was the most successful Star Wars property._  
但是，因为这很有趣，所以我简单介绍一下：J·J·艾布拉姆斯制作的东西或多或少复制了老电影。它是故意为“粉丝”设计的。我们可以在另一部不成功的支线电影《游侠索罗》中看到这一点，它从字面上告诉我们为什么他被称为汉·索罗以及他从哪里得到他的爆能枪以及其他一切，我们可以在《崛起》中看到这一点天行者的。卢卡斯的成功是因为他每次都能创造出新的东西。这就是为什么迪士尼制作的最成功的星球大战电影是《最后的绝地武士》，这部电影在家庭视频中的受欢迎程度达到了令人厌恶的程度。互联网上的一些混蛋很生气（他们购买机器人在烂番茄上留下负面评论哈哈）但实际上，《最后的绝地武士》是最成功的《星球大战》作品。

Audiences do not want the same thing for very long. My co-writer and dear friend Phillip Bastien, who is an expert in marketing and audience sentiment, has pointed out to me that nostalgia sits on a ten to fifteen year clock. Successful reboots tend to take _time_. Lots of time.  
观众不会长久地想要同样的东西。我的合著者兼亲爱的朋友菲利普·巴斯蒂安（Phillip Bastien）是营销和观众情绪方面的专家，他向我指出，怀旧情绪是有十年到十五年的历史的。成功的重新启动往往需要时间。很多时间。

![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/640x480,sNAxcmfQhnK63T0LuH4OcPFDxwmTwaIn04h344hnVoTQ/https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1280/0*iMfqiNa2l9VT4yfA.jpg)

There’s a gag in The Simpsons where a disco-loving character named Disco Stu points at the data, claiming that as of 1976, disco record sales were climbing, and projected to keep climbing… _forever_. As some of you may know, Disco was all but dead by 1980, hence the joke in the episode, making fun at Disco Stu’s expense.  
《辛普森一家》中有一个笑话，一位名叫迪斯科·斯图 (Disco Stu) 的迪斯科爱好者指向数据，声称截至 1976 年，迪斯科唱片销量一直在攀升，并且预计将永远持续攀升。你们中有些人可能知道，迪斯科在 1980 年几乎已经消亡，因此这一集中有一个笑话，取笑迪斯科·斯图的利益。

Executives are a lot like Disco Stu. They see numbers going up, and they expect it to go up forever.  
高管们很像迪斯科·斯图。他们看到数字在上升，并期望数字会永远上升。

A smart executive would say “okay, Marvel needs to take a breather. Star Wars needs to take a breather.” They’d look at their work and they’d go “okay, what blew up, what went wrong?”  
一位聪明的高管会说：“好吧，漫威需要喘口气。星球大战需要喘口气。”他们会审视自己的工作，然后说：“好吧，出了什么问题，出了什么问题？”

They’d want to factor in the Sequel Latency Problem—a work tends to perform based on the _previous_ work in a series. A strong opening work will release in a _bigger_ sequel, but if that sequel isn’t as good as the original, then the _third_ entry will perform _worse_.  
他们想要考虑续集延迟问题——一部作品往往会基于系列中的前一部作品来执行。一部强大的开场作品将在更大的续集中发布，但如果续集不如原作那么好，那么第三部作品的表现就会更差。

But you can’t do this if you have to make more money every year.  
但如果你每年都必须赚更多的钱，你就无法做到这一点。

If you put all your eggs in one basket and you drop the basket, what happens? Well, you don’t have any more eggs, that’s for sure. They’re splattered all over the fucking ground. Best leave ’em for ants, I guess, cause you sure as hell ain’t getting to eat ‘em.  
如果你把所有鸡蛋放在一个篮子里，然后篮子掉了，会发生什么？好吧，你没有更多的鸡蛋了，这是肯定的。它们溅满了地上。我想，最好把它们留给蚂蚁，因为你肯定吃不到它们。

There is no “people love soybeans and they will never stop loving them” when it comes to media. As Phil has also pointed out to me, while _nostalgia_ operates on 15 year cycles or so, _a brand_ can only last _about ten years_. After that, the brand starts dying.  
在媒体方面，不存在“人们爱大豆，而且永远不会停止爱大豆”的说法。正如 Phil 还向我指出的那样，虽然怀旧情绪以 15 年左右为周期，但一个品牌只能持续大约 10 年。此后，该品牌开始消亡。

When did Avengers: Endgame release? 2019\. When did Iron Man begin the Marvel Cinematic Universe? 2008\. Just about ten years.  
复仇者联盟：终局之战什么时候上映？ 2019\. 钢铁侠什么时候开始漫威电影宇宙？ 2008年，大约十年了。

And now, they keep releasing movies, and the movies keep underperforming, unless a very strong creative like Sam Raimi is at the helm, which is why he made the only truly huge post-Endgame marvel movie. Why? Because Sam Raimi is a fucking expert; you may be tired of _superhero movies_, but Sam Raimi is that kind of expert that the ‘leaders’ are jealous of — he knows the craft and he can do an amazing job with an amazing movie.  
现在，他们不断发行电影，但电影的表现一直不佳，除非有像萨姆·雷米这样非常强大的创意人来掌舵，这就是为什么他制作了唯一一部真正意义上的大片《终局之战》后的漫威电影。为什么？因为山姆·雷米是个他妈的专家；你可能厌倦了超级英雄电影，但萨姆·雷米（Sam Raimi）是那种让“领导者”嫉妒的专家——他了解这门手艺，他可以用一部出色的电影做出出色的工作。

That’s the _same reason_ why Top Gun: Maverick did so well that same year — it was an excellent movie made by people at the top of their game. As you may be aware, the latest Mission: Impossible did _not_ do as well as Top Gun: Maverick. Why? It’s a respected brand, a reliable moneymaker, and it had Tom Cruise attached, so why did it fail where Top Gun succeeded?  
这也是《壮志凌云：特立独行》同年表现如此出色的原因——这是一部由行业顶尖人士制作的优秀电影。你可能知道，最新的《碟中谍》的表现不如《壮志凌云：特立独行》。为什么？这是一个受人尊敬的品牌，一个可靠的赚钱机器，而且还拥有汤姆·克鲁斯，那么为什么《壮志凌云》成功了，它却失败了呢？

Easy: Tom Cruise isn’t the brand, Top Gun isn’t the brand any more than Mission: Impossible is, but a _really good fucking movie made by good craftsmen_ will get the audience, as long as you do a good job marketing it.  
简单：汤姆·克鲁斯不是品牌，《壮志凌云》比《碟中谍》更不是品牌，但是一部由优秀工匠制作的真正优秀的电影将吸引观众，只要你做好营销工作。 。

Mission: Impossible is following a stupid trend of “we are making a really bloated entry in the series and splitting it into two parts” started by, what, the last Harry Potter movie? Twilight? The Hunger Games? The Avengers? As you might be aware, this trend worked for _adaptations of already existing stories that people already know about_, but it does _not_ work so well for, say, Mission: Impossible.  
《碟中谍》正在追随一种愚蠢的趋势，即“我们正在该系列中制作一个非常臃肿的条目，并将其分成两部分”，这是从最后一部哈利·波特电影开始的？暮？饥饿游戏？复仇者？正如您可能知道的那样，这种趋势适用于人们已经了解的现有故事的改编，但对于《碟中谍》等作品来说效果不佳。

Those stories need to be stand-alone. If Top Gun: Maverick had released as Top Gun: Maverick: Part 1: The Chronicle of Goose’s Kid or whatever, _nobody would give a shit._  
这些故事必须是独立的。如果《壮志凌云：特立独行》以《壮志凌云：特立独行：第一部分：鹅孩子编年史》之类的形式发行，那么没人会在意。

It is _essential_ that you only ever do this with a series if you’re adapting a heavily-anticipated work (Dune!) and not if you are creating new material in a property you own (Top Gun, Star Wars).  
重要的是，只有当您正在改编备受期待的作品（《沙丘》！）而不是在您拥有的财产中创建新材料（《壮志凌云》、《星球大战》）时，您才可以在系列中这样做。

Okay, so far, here’s where we’re at:  
好的，到目前为止，这就是我们所处的位置：

1. a business’s purpose is to make a product or provide a service…  
企业的目的是制造产品或提供服务……
2. …to _customers_, who are human beings, who will _make_ decisions based on their _desires_.  
……客户是人，他们会根据自己的愿望做出决定。
3. And since humans _are not simple machines_, their reasons for buying your product are _extremely complex_, especially when it comes to _entertainment_, a business that will always make money and is fairly recession-proof, but won’t work if it _isn’t entertaining_.  
由于人类不是简单的机器，他们购买产品的原因极其复杂，尤其是在娱乐方面，这项业务总是能赚钱，而且相当能抵御经济衰退，但如果没有娱乐性，就不会成功。 。
4. And humans _get tired_, like batteries drain and fields need to lie fallow. You cannot extract from them infinitely by inputting a predictable “entertainment value.”  
人类会感到疲倦，就像电池耗尽、田地需要休耕一样。你无法通过输入可预测的“娱乐价值”来无限地从中获取。
5. But, unfortunately for us, a lot of stupid motherfuckers are obsessed with ‘data’ and they keep making decisions that fuck them up because, as it turns out, that’s not how data works or should be used. It’s how we lost Vietnam, and why the board of Boeing has to step the fuck down.  
但是，对我们来说不幸的是，很多愚蠢的混蛋痴迷于“数据”，他们不断做出让自己陷入困境的决定，因为事实证明，这不是数据的工作方式或应该使用的方式。这就是我们失去越南的原因，也是波音董事会必须他妈下台的原因。

There is only one way to run a successful, sustainable business, rather than one that burns too bright and burns the fuck out. There’s a way to succeed without disastrous consequences, to make more money than these fuckin’ bozos ever dreamed of: and that’s to make something people want to spend money on instead of fucking around with balance sheets and trying to convince yourself that makes you good at what you do.  
经营一家成功、可持续发展的企业只有一种方法，而不是一种烧得太亮、烧得精光的方法。有一种方法可以在不造成灾难性后果的情况下取得成功，赚到比这些该死的笨蛋梦想的更多的钱：那就是制造人们愿意花钱的东西，而不是在资产负债表上乱搞，并试图说服自己让自己擅长你做什么。

You can’t just make the same thing over and over and over again and become successful, buddy. You gotta try new things.  
你不可能一次又一次地做同样的事情并取得成功，伙计。你必须尝试新事物。

## Alright now, wasn’t that fun?  
好吧，这不是很有趣吗？

Let’s try something else. You’re probably sitting here going “But, Doc, in video games, the most valuable corporation is Valve. Valve does exactly what you say a company can’t do, and they’re one of the wealthiest corporations in the business.”  
让我们尝试一些别的东西。你可能坐在这里说：“但是，博士，在电子游戏领域，最有价值的公司是 Valve。 Valve 所做的正是你所说的一家公司做不到的事情，而且他们是业内最富有的公司之一。”

Correct. 正确的。

Someone else pointed out to me that FIFA and Madden are perennial best sellers that no one ever seems to tire from. Isn’t that also proof that my argument is incorrect?  
还有人向我指出，《FIFA》和《Madden》是常年畅销的游戏，似乎没有人会厌倦。这不也证明了我的论点是错误的吗？

Nope. But we should probably talk about _why_ those things work, alright?  
没有。但我们也许应该谈谈为什么这些东西有效，好吗？

Let’s start with sports, because it’s shorter. The issue here is exclusivity — people are playing sports games for the fantasy of playing their favorite teams. A team is different than entertainment; when I tell you the story of She-Hulk winning the legal case of the millennium, that story has to be good as hell, because it’s _entertainment_.  
让我们从体育开始，因为它更短。这里的问题是排他性——人们玩体育游戏是为了幻想与自己喜欢的球队比赛。团队不同于娱乐；当我告诉你女绿巨人赢得千年法律诉讼的故事时，这个故事一定非常精彩，因为它是娱乐。

With sports, your _identity_ as a fan is _tied_ to an institution. Maybe you’re from Philly, so you’re an Eagles fan, or, like me, you’re from Kansas City, so you get a sense of _hometown pride_ when the Chiefs dominate the Super Bowl, right?  
对于体育运动，您作为球迷的身份与机构息息相关。也许你来自费城，所以你是老鹰队的球迷，或者，像我一样，你来自堪萨斯城，所以当酋长队统治超级碗时，你会有一种家乡自豪感，对吗？

There is an ebb and flow; your _identity_ is tied to the team’s success or failure, and the game is played by live, human actors, _improvising_ on the spot. You’re following actual, real humans — Mahomes, Jordan, Pele — and watching them win or fail but always _try their best_.  
有潮起潮落；你的身份与团队的成功或失败息息相关，游戏由真人演员现场即兴表演。你正在追随真实的人类——马霍姆斯、乔丹、贝利——看着他们获胜或失败，但总是尽力而为。

This form of entertainment is exciting because _you have no idea what is going to happen_. In sports, a bunch of people in real time are putting everything on the line to try and outdo the other people. There _is_ no storyteller. It’s _real_.  
这种娱乐形式很令人兴奋，因为你不知道会发生什么。在体育运动中，一群人实时地投入一切，试图超越其他人。没有讲故事的人。它是真实的。

So… for most people, a fake football league playing the game does _nothing_ for them. The joy of playing FIFA is that you’re playing real teams that compete in FIFA. It’s aspirational. We _know_ Luke Skywalker is going to win, so the artist must go _all out_ in conveying to us why Luke Skywalker is entertaining. In sports, we’re just hoping the people on ‘our’ side win.  
所以……对于大多数人来说，玩这个游戏的假足球联盟对他们没有任何帮助。玩 FIFA 的乐趣在于，你正在与在 FIFA 中竞争的真实球队进行比赛。这是有抱负的。我们知道卢克·天行者将会获胜，所以艺术家必须全力以赴地向我们传达卢克·天行者为什么有趣。在体育运动中，我们只是希望“我们”一方的人获胜。

So, since EA has all the licenses, people buy the games from EA. There is no competition — the NFL was furious that 2K Sports was discounting NFL games (because they were yearly releases) at $39.99 instead of the industry premium of $49.99, so they pulled the license and gave it to EA, who realized they could do that with _everyone_. EA’s goal is exclusivity via licensing.  
因此，由于 EA 拥有所有许可证，人们从 EA 购买游戏。没有竞争——NFL 对 2K Sports 以 39.99 美元的价格打折 NFL 游戏（因为它们是每年发布）而不是行业溢价 49.99 美元感到愤怒，因此他们取消了许可并将其交给 EA，EA 意识到他们可以做到这一点与大家。 EA 的目标是通过许可获得排他性。

Of course, look at how EA’s Star Wars games have been… lackluster compared to their sports game sales. With sports games, they’re the only people in town — everyone else has to use fake sports teams. With entertainment properties… people already know we _can_ do better.  
当然，看看 EA 的《星球大战》游戏……与他们的体育游戏销量相比，表现平平。在体育比赛中，他们是镇上唯一的人——其他人都必须使用假运动队。有了娱乐产业……人们已经知道我们可以做得更好。

Sure, the awfully-written Star Wars space dogfighting game was kinda fun (though it didn’t hold a candle to Ace Combat, which outsold it by absolutely batshit insane amounts — Ace Combat is freakishly successful, apparently, shocking Bamco after its lengthy hiatus), and Jedi: Fallen Order did great (because who doesn’t want to play a not-as-hard-as-Souls swordfighting sci-fi adventure rom?), but the next Jedi game had such bad PC performance, apparently it’s not doing nearly as well.  
当然，这款写得糟糕的《星球大战》太空格斗游戏还是有点有趣的（尽管它比不上《皇牌空战》，后者的销量绝对是疯狂的——《皇牌空战》显然取得了惊人的成功，在长时间的停顿后让 Bamco 感到震惊） ），《绝地：陨落的武士团》表现出色（因为谁不想玩一款不像《魂》那么难的剑战科幻冒险 ROM？），但下一款《绝地武士》的 PC 性能如此糟糕，显然是做得不太好。

Battlefront never had 4-player co-op, and the less said about the loot box debacle, the better.  
《前线》从未有过 4 人合作模式，关于战利品箱崩溃的说法越少越好。

The most exciting looking Star Wars game on the Horizon? Surprisingly, it’s Ubisoft’s [Star Wars: Outlaws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7K2TA0bBpY). Lucasfilm made a very good decision in taking exclusivity back from Electronic Arts. That kills competition. EA is just lucky to have a license that no one can really, like… challenge. I can’t prove to the NFL or FIFA I can make them more money than EA, because I can’t make a sports game that will succeed as well as a game with branding I’m legally not allowed to use, right?  
地平线上最令人兴奋的星球大战游戏？令人惊讶的是，这是育碧的《星球大战：神枪手》。卢卡斯影业从艺电手中夺回独家经营权是一个非常明智的决定。这会扼杀竞争。 EA 很幸运能够拥有无人能真正挑战的许可证。我无法向 NFL 或 FIFA 证明我可以为他们赚到比 EA 更多的钱，因为我无法制作出一款能够取得成功的体育游戏，以及一款法律上不允许我使用品牌的游戏，对吧？

And then there’s Valve. 然后是阀门。

Valve was, once upon a time, considered _the_ best fucking studio in the whole world. The graphics wars of the early aughts were something that had to be seen to be be believed. For the longest time, Half-Life 2 (which was absolutely the best-looking game at the time, though I’d disagree that it was an exceptional shooter for a whole heck of a lot of reasons that I think most people would agree are fair if we had that discussion) was considered to be the best game ever made by magazines like PC Gamer. If Valve made a game, it was considered quality.  
Valve 曾经被认为是全世界最好的工作室。早期的图形战争必须亲眼所见才能相信。在最长的时间里，《半条命 2》（这绝对是当时最好看的游戏，尽管我不同意它是一款出色的射击游戏，原因有很多，我认为大多数人都会同意：如果我们进行这样的讨论就公平了）被《PC Gamer》等杂志认为是有史以来最好的游戏。如果 Valve 制作了一款游戏，那么它就被认为是高质量的。

Now, I want you to know something: I fucking _love_ Valve. Buuuuut… I am going to be critical of Valve here. I am a guy who would love to tour their offices, talk to Gabe Newell about the business of games, learn everything there is to learn about Valve. I like a _lot_ about Valve. You might not think it after reading this, but I really, truly do.  
现在，我想让你知道一件事：我他妈的爱 Valve。 Buuuuut…我要在这里批评 Valve。我是一个喜欢参观他们的办公室、与 Gabe Newell 谈论游戏业务、了解有关 Valve 的一切的人。我非常喜欢 Valve。读完本文后你可能不会这么想，但我真的真的这么想。

I do, actually, like them. But I am trying to explain problems, and right here, right now, I am trying to explain to you why you, who may be asking me “why can’t I just be like Valve” cannot _be_ Valve. So I’m going to sound critical here, but please don’t take me as a hater. Yes, I don’t love Half-Life 2, but so what? I think Half-Life and OP4 are two of the best games ever made, Portal’s a stone cold classic, Steam is a library I have 3500 games on, and the Steam Deck is one of the best things in gaming today.  
事实上，我确实喜欢他们。但我试图解释问题，就在这里，此时此刻，我试图向你解释，为什么你，可能会问我“为什么我不能像 Valve 一样”，不能成为 Valve。所以我会在这里听起来很批评，但请不要把我当作一个仇恨者。是的，我不喜欢《半条命 2》，但那又怎样呢？我认为《Half-Life》和《OP4》是有史以来最好的两款游戏，《Portal》是一款冷酷经典，Steam 是我拥有 3500 款游戏的库，而 Steam Deck 是当今游戏界最好的东西之一。

So I’m going to talk about problems, but please don’t take this as me being unfair. I’m trying to explain why you can’t be like Valve, which means talking about problems you’d have to overcome to, well, _be like Valve_.  
所以我要谈谈问题，但请不要认为我不公平。我试图解释为什么你不能像 Valve 那样，这意味着谈论你必须克服的问题才能像 Valve 那样。

And unfortunately, even though Valve is _wildly successful_, and we’ll explain why in a minute, _their star is waning too_.  
不幸的是，尽管 Valve 取得了巨大的成功，我们稍后会解释为什么，但他们的明星也在衰落。

It’s just… they won’t die, even if they never made another game.  
只是……他们不会死，即使他们从未制作过其他游戏。

Now, I don’t really do sentiment analysis as much these days, but I do still have an eye for trends, and I’ve noticed over the past decade or more, as Valve broke the promise of Half-Life 2: Episode 3, as they said “Portal 2 might be the last single player game we make,” and as they suffered the company equivalent of brain drain (which should just be called brain drain, but that term explicitly refers to people leaving _nations_ for other nations to become talent there, and not corporations), with remarkable people like Clint Hocking, Viktor Antonov, Kelly Bailey, Kim Swift, and Marc Laidlaw leaving… you can see as the public respect goes down. People… don’t respect Valve as much these days, outside of Valve-dedicated circles, but those are far smaller than you think.  
现在，我现在已经不太做情感分析了，但我仍然关注趋势，而且我在过去十年或更长时间里注意到了，Valve 违背了《半条命 2：第 3 章》的承诺，正如他们所说的“传送门 2 可能是我们制作的最后一款单人游戏”，并且他们遭受了相当于公司人才流失的情况（应该称为人才流失，但该术语明确指的是人们离开一个国家前往其他国家）在那里成为人才，而不是公司），克林特·霍金、维克托·安东诺夫、凯利·贝利、金·斯威夫特和马克·莱德劳等杰出人士离开……你可以看到公众尊重度下降。如今，在 Valve 专用圈子之外，人们……不再那么尊重 Valve，但这些圈子比你想象的要小得多。

Sure, Valve still has fans. Most of ’em are pretty rabid. While Valve hasn’t really done much to support modders (someone on Twitter once pointed out that was a very short period of time, and we’re further then from the entire length of time that period lasted), and has, in fact, done a lot of weird things against modders (arbitrarily changing how much you get if your mod gets in loot crates, trying to introduce paid mods where the people who do the work get the least cut, etc), there’s still a vibrant culture there, kept alive by studios like Facepunch.  
当然，Valve 仍然有粉丝。他们中的大多数人都非常狂热。虽然 Valve 并没有真正为模组制作者提供太多支持（Twitter 上有人曾经指出那是一个非常短的时间段，而我们距离那段时间持续的整个时间还很远），但事实上，对 modders 做了很多奇怪的事情（任意改变你的 mod 进入战利品箱时获得的金额，试图引入付费 mods，让做工作的人得到最少的报酬，等等），那里仍然有一个充满活力的文化，由 Facepunch 等工作室保持活力。

When people want to start up a competing store, Steam fans do _everything_ they can to lie about that store and tear it down. Look at how many people made up shit about Epic, like “it’s bad because it doesn’t have a cart” (it has for some time, and also, the Switch didn’t, but these people didn’t complain about that), “Epic sends your telemetry to China” (a racist redditor tried to say that partial investment by a Chinese company meant that any telemetry Epic sent was automatically spying for a foreign power).  
当人们想要开设一家竞争商店时，Steam 粉丝会尽一切努力对该商店撒谎并将其拆除。看看有多少人编造了关于 Epic 的狗屎，比如“它很糟糕，因为它没有购物车”（它已经有一段时间了，而且 Switch 也没有，但这些人并没有抱怨这一点） ，“Epic 将你的遥测数据发送到中国”（一位种族主义 Reddit 用户试图说，一家中国公司的部分投资意味着 Epic 发送的任何遥测数据都会自动为外国势力进行间谍活动）。

Fun fact: someone did the work and found that Valve actually sends more telemetry about your computer to itself than Epic ever did. I see people still claiming Epic moneyhats exclusives (this isn’t true. Epic, for a period of less than a year, funded some games that were _on Kickstarter_ as exclusives, and the issue there was people backed those understanding they were coming to Steam. Epic ceased that behavior. They have spent more time doing their regular publishing stuff, but that’s no different than any publisher out there).  
有趣的事实：有人做了这项工作，发现 Valve 实际上向自己发送了比 Epic 更多的有关您计算机的遥测数据。我看到人们仍然声称 Epic 是独占游戏（这不是真的。Epic 在不到一年的时间里资助了一些在 Kickstarter 上作为独占游戏的游戏，而问题是人们支持那些了解他们将登陆 Steam 的人Epic 停止了这种行为。他们花了更多的时间来做常规的出版工作，但这与任何出版商没有什么不同）。

The point I’m making here isn’t that there’s a problem with Valve — they can’t control their fans — but if you want to set up a store, well… you’re going to have to contend with that fanbase.  
我在这里想说的并不是 Valve 有问题——他们无法控制自己的粉丝——但如果你想开一家商店，那么……你就必须与粉丝群抗衡。

But that’s the fanbase for the _store_. If Epic can’t do it, if Microsoft can’t do it, if EA and Ubisoft and CD Projekt Red can’t do it… then you probably can’t either. So if you’re sitting there believing that you can run a company like Valve, you need to understand: Valve can afford this because it makes money on Steam. Do you have a Steam equivalent? Probably not.  
但这就是商店的粉丝群。如果 Epic 做不到，如果 Microsoft 做不到，如果 EA、Ubisoft 和 CD Projekt Red 做不到……那么你可能也做不到。因此，如果您坐在那里相信自己可以经营像 Valve 这样的公司，您需要明白：Valve 负担得起，因为它在 Steam 上赚钱。 Steam 有类似的东西吗？可能不会。

You could release the best store in the world right now and most players would not switch because… the switching costs are high. Your saves are there. Your friends. Your screenshots. Most people would not give up a library they’ve invested decades of years and thousands of dollars in to rebuy all those games elsewhere.  
你现在可以发布世界上最好的商店，但大多数玩家不会切换，因为……切换成本很高。你的保存就在那里。你的朋友们。你的截图。大多数人不会放弃他们投入了数十年和数千美元的图书馆来在其他地方重新购买所有这些游戏。

So if you don’t have a Valve amount of money rolling in every day, you can’t make games like Valve does.  
因此，如果你没有 Valve 每天源源不断的资金，你就无法像 Valve 那样制作游戏。

That said, after Valve’s Portal 2 announcement of “we probably won’t make more singleplayer games,” people don’t really _expect_ Valve to be able to make amazing games anymore. No one’s holding their breath for Half-Life 3\. Half-Life Alyx, made in part by members of the Firewatch team… came and went. You know what I hear about that? More people saying “we’re never getting In The Valley of the Gods, are we?” and not “you need to play Alyx.” One of the most storied series in gaming and people aren’t frothing at the mouth for it? Say it ain’t so. You could say “oh, well, that’s because VR isn’t big,” and you’d be right. So why’d Valve do it?  
也就是说，在 Valve 的 Portal 2 宣布“我们可能不会制作更多单人游戏”之后，人们不再真正期望 Valve 能够制作出令人惊叹的游戏。没有人对《半条命 3》翘首以待。《半条命 Alyx》（部分由 Firewatch 团队成员制作）……来了又走。你知道我听到了什么吗？更多的人说“我们永远无法进入众神之谷，不是吗？”而不是“你需要扮演爱莉克斯”。游戏界最具传奇色彩的系列之一，人们并没有为它口吐白沫？说不是这样的。你可能会说“哦，好吧，那是因为 VR 规模不大”，你是对的。那么 Valve 为何要这么做呢？

Pretty simple: 很简单：

Valve makes money because they own _the_ store. Valve is bigger than Playstation, Xbox, and Nintendo. They have more average users per day, week, month, and year than either ‘first party.’ They take more of a cut — commonly considered to be about 33% — than anybody else does, and they can do that because… what can you do? They offer lower rates to _big_ clients — like Activision — but everybody else? You and me? The small indies? We’re stuck with a third of the entire game getting cut even before taxes.  
Valve 赚钱是因为他们拥有这家商店。 Valve 比 Playstation、Xbox 和任天堂还要大。他们每天、每周、每月和每年的平均用户数量比任何一个“第一方”都多。他们比其他任何人都获得更多的分成（通常被认为约为 33%），他们能做到这一点是因为……有什么可以做到的？你做？他们向动视暴雪等大客户提供较低的费率，但其他人呢？你和我？小独立国家？整个游戏的三分之一甚至在税前就被削减了。

We can’t take our ball and go elsewhere — Valve is around 80% of my sales for the simple reason that they were there _first_, and as we said above, most people have invested time and money into Steam that they can’t just switch on a whim, and why should they? There’s no reason to. Valve is the monopoly (“buh-buh-buh technically it’s a — “ shut the fuck up); you can’t do business in games if you aren’t releasing stuff on Valve.  
我们不能带着我们的球去其他地方——Valve 占我销售额的 80% 左右，原因很简单，他们首先在那里，正如我们上面所说，大多数人都在 Steam 上投入了时间和金钱，但他们不能仅仅在 Steam 上投入时间和金钱。一时兴起就打开电源，为什么要这样做呢？没有理由这样做。 Valve 是垄断者（“buh-buh-buh 从技术上讲，这是一个——”他妈的闭嘴）；如果你不在 Valve 上发布东西，你就无法在游戏领域开展业务。

Epic is the next-biggest store for us, but even it’s closer to 5% of sales than 50%. It’s good to be there — we make more money per copy of the game sold there because Epic has great rates — but we _can’t_ exist as a company without being on Steam, and we can’t negotiate with them at all. As some indie friends put it to me, “you have to hit a specific, not-listed financial target before someone from Valve pays attention to you internally.” There’s a lot of unwritten rules like that.  
Epic 是我们第二大商店，但即使它占销售额的比例也接近 5%，而不是 50%。在那里很高兴——我们在那里销售的每份游戏都能赚更多的钱，因为 Epic 的价格很高——但如果没有 Steam，我们就无法作为一家公司存在，而且我们根本无法与他们谈判。正如一些独立朋友对我说的那样，“在 Valve 内部有人关注你之前，你必须达到一个特定的、未列出的财务目标。”诸如此类的不成文规则还有很多。

But as a customer? Valve was there first, did a great job with Steam, and now they’re figuring out how to grow beyond that. That’s why they’re getting into hardware — so they can be the default there too. It’s smart business. I completely understand why Valve would want to do this and I can’t fault them for that.  
但作为客户呢？ Valve 是最先出现的，在 Steam 上做得很好，现在他们正在考虑如何超越这一点。这就是他们进入硬件领域的原因——这样它们也可以成为那里的默认设置。这是明智的生意。我完全理解 Valve 为何要这么做，我也不能因此责怪他们。

Talking with a bundle site recently, I was informed that Valve was actively going out of its way to prevent indie developers from releasing their games in bundles. That’s… not good! It costs Valve nothing to let us generate keys; if we’re doing it, it’s because we need to make money. Trust me, I would never want to put my game on a bundle site if I could help it, but once a game reaches its end of life, that’s the best way to get one last hurrah out of it.  
最近与一个捆绑网站交谈时，我获悉 Valve 正在积极采取措施阻止独立开发者以捆绑方式发布他们的游戏。这不好！ Valve 让我们生成密钥不需要花费任何费用；如果我们这样做，那是因为我们需要赚钱。相信我，如果可以的话，我绝不会想把我的游戏放在捆绑网站上，但一旦游戏生命周期结束，这就是摆脱它最后一次欢呼的最佳方式。

But Valve has a few other ways to make money; the obvious one is _“video games_._”_ You make a game, people buy it, and you make money off of the sale. But because Valve owns _Steam_, and Valve distributes their games through Steam, Valve can… invent entire systems to support their games’ ability to make money. Some of those ways are… uh, uncomfortable to me, personally.  
但 Valve 还有其他一些赚钱方式：最明显的一个是“视频游戏”。你制作一款游戏，人们购买它，然后你就可以从销售中赚钱。但因为 Valve 拥有 Steam，而 Valve 通过 Steam 发行他们的游戏，Valve 可以……发明整个系统来支持他们的游戏赚钱的能力。其中一些方式……呃，就我个人而言，让我感到不舒服。

For a long, long time, Valve’s microtransaction system gives you a treasure chest you can’t open, and when influencers create gambling sites to lure children into spending money to buy loot directly, Valve finally had to stop it because it was enabling [literal worldwide fraud](https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/29/20937992/csgo-counter-strike-valve-key-trading-banned-fraud-network). Even EA’s Battlefield key system wasn’t resulting in that. Valve put together an entire economic system and gamified it to get people to spend _far_ more money than random loot boxes.  
很长一段时间以来，Valve 的微交易系统给了你一个打不开的宝箱，当有影响力的人创建赌博网站来引诱孩子们花钱直接购买战利品时，Valve 最终不得不阻止它，因为它在全球范围内实现了字面意义。欺诈罪。甚至 EA 的《战地》按键系统也没有导致这种情况。 Valve 构建了一个完整的经济系统，并将其游戏化，让人们花的钱比随机的战利品箱多得多。

See, I might not want to buy a loot box in Genshin, but if I “win” a loot box in a Valve game… then it’s just sitting in my inventory, useless. Inviting. Waiting. Encouraging. “You wanna buy a key, right? You wanna know what’s inside…”  
看，我可能不想在《原神》中购买战利品盒，但如果我在 Valve 游戏中“赢得”了一个战利品盒……那么它就只是放在我的库存中，毫无用处。邀请。等待。令人鼓舞。 “你想买一把钥匙，对吧？你想知道里面是什么……”

For a while, they were offering loot boxes that had assets created by random developers around the world — not employees, but kids with hopes and dreams of making things for games. They gave people a cut, and at one point, I recall a bunch of those modders being _pretty upset_ when Valve dramatically reduced their cut, the number of times they could come up in loot boxes, and Valve gave itself a higher cut.  
有一段时间，他们提供了战利品盒，里面有世界各地随机开发者创建的资产——不是员工，而是那些怀揣着为游戏制作东西的希望和梦想的孩子。他们给了人们提成，我记得有一次，当 Valve 大幅减少他们的提成（他们可以出现在战利品箱中的次数），而 Valve 却给了自己更高的提成时，一群改装者感到非常沮丧。

That’s not great! I don’t know the ins and outs of that, obviously, but I think someone should talk to Valve about that stuff. In an ideal world, it’s fine because there’s competition. Valve has no competition. Game devs cannot function without Steam unless they’re like… a well-established Japanese studio making small games for the Playstation and Switch only. But even that’s changing — more and more teams are bringing their games to Steam.  
那不太好！显然，我不知道其中的来龙去脉，但我认为应该有人和 Valve 谈谈这些事情。在理想的世界里，这很好，因为有竞争。 Valve 没有竞争对手。游戏开发者如果没有 Steam 就无法运作，除非他们像……一家成熟的日本工作室，只为 Playstation 和 Switch 制作小游戏。但即便如此，情况也在发生变化——越来越多的团队将他们的游戏带到 Steam 上。

Gabe Newell said, at one point, that Valve would, ideally, turn Steam into an API where every single person in the industry could buy a game from any store — the labor and costs of hosting and running that store would go to the people doing the store part. You’d buy a game, and that would automatically unlock it on Steam (they even did it for a while on Humble — you didn’t buy keys, you bought a button that you could click to unlock the game on Steam).  
加布·纽厄尔 (Gabe Newell) 曾表示，理想情况下，Valve 将把 Steam 变成一个 API，行业中的每个人都可以从任何商店购买游戏——托管和运营该商店的劳动力和成本将由那些从事该工作的人承担。商店部分。你买了一款游戏，就会在 Steam 上自动解锁（他们甚至在 Humble 上做过一段时间——你没有购买密钥，你买了一个按钮，你可以点击它在 Steam 上解锁游戏）。

Valve would become the _ultimate tollbooth_, taking a cut of every game ever, outsourcing a lot of work to other people. It’s what Silicon Valley tries to do these days, how Google and Facebook took over the ad economy. It’s the way to become the biggest business: become the _default_.  
Valve 将成为最终的收费站，从每款游戏中抽取分成，并将大量工作外包给其他人。这就是硅谷最近试图做的事情，谷歌和 Facebook 接管了广告经济。这是成为最大企业的方法：成为默认。

It’s just, 2003 was a different time. It’s harder to do that these days — the internet’s been fully corporatized; there’s no more land rush.  
只是，2003 年是一个不同的时代。如今，做到这一点更加困难了——互联网已经完全公司化；不再有土地抢购的情况。

Now, okay, I don’t really like that on a personal level, because I believe a company that does that sort of thing gets _lazy and falls apart_, because nature always tries to find the simplest course of action to function, and humans are natural creatures.  
现在，好吧，我个人并不喜欢这样，因为我相信做这种事情的公司会变得懒惰并崩溃，因为大自然总是试图找到最简单的行动方案来运作，而人类是自然生物。

This is what we call “perverse incentives.”  
这就是我们所说的“不正当激励”。

Back in the 1800s or so, when the British had no right to be in India but were nevertheless, the British decided that snakes had to go. They just weren’t big fans. Heck, the story “Rikki Tikki Tavi” is literally about a heroic mongoose that kills snakes during this time period.  
早在 1800 年代左右，当时英国人无权进入印度，但尽管如此，英国人还是决定必须驱逐蛇。他们只是不是忠实粉丝。哎呀，故事“Rikki Tikki Tavi”实际上是关于这一时期一只英勇的猫鼬杀死蛇的故事。

So they said “okay, hey, anyone who brings us a dead snake gets a reward.”  
所以他们说：“好吧，嘿，任何给我们带来死蛇的人都会得到奖励。”

Well, a lot of poor people went “okay, so… the more snakes we give you, the more we profit, right?”  
好吧，很多穷人说：“好吧，所以……我们给你的蛇越多，我们赚到的钱就越多，对吗？”

The British, being idiots, said “yes, absolutely.”  
英国人像白痴一样说：“是的，绝对的。”

And the people they were paying went “ALRIGHT, SNAKES, GET TO FUCKIN’.”  
而他们付钱的人则说：“好吧，蛇，去他妈的吧。”

And they started breeding as many snakes as humanly possible. The _goal_ was to reduce the amount of snakes. The _result_ increased the amount of snakes in the world, because people wanted _money_.  
他们开始尽可能多地繁殖蛇。目标是减少蛇的数量。结果世界上蛇的数量增加了，因为人们想要钱。

Remember how we talked about how business types try to reduce everything to the simplest available metrics and data, and how that was bad? Well, one of the things these guys love the most is “how much money did you make for us?”  
还记得我们如何讨论业务类型如何尝试将所有内容简化为最简单的可用指标和数据，以及这有什么不好的吗？好吧，这些家伙最喜欢的事情之一就是“你为我们赚了多少钱？”

Now, the thing about Valve is that Valve actually bases your ability to stay at the company by ineffectively [stack-ranking them](https://www.pcgamer.com/valves-unusual-corporate-structure-causes-its-problems-report-suggests/). I read a few years ago that the predominant determining factor in stack-ranking at Valve is “how much money do you make the company?”  
现在，Valve 的问题是，Valve 实际上通过对他们进行无效的堆栈排名来确定你留在公司的能力。几年前我读到，Valve 堆栈排名的主要决定因素是“你为公司赚了多少钱？”

A few years ago, Valve’s employee handbook ‘leaked’ and made Valve sound like an amazing place to work. That said, I once worked with this dude on a project in about 2016, who insisted that we follow Valve’s handbook because that would make us “so much better.” What he actually wanted was to do whatever he wanted with no accountability. He abused some people on the team, left, and then spent years trying to start whisper campaigns about us. As you can probably guess, I’m not a big fan of flat management; it lets assholes hide abuse because there’s no chain of responsibility.  
几年前，Valve 的员工手册“泄露”，让 Valve 听起来像是一个很棒的工作场所。也就是说，我曾在 2016 年左右与这个家伙合作过一个项目，他坚持要求我们遵循 Valve 的手册，因为这会让我们“变得更好”。他真正想要的是做任何他想做的事情，而不需要承担任何责任。他辱骂了团队中的一些人，然后离开了，然后花了数年时间试图发起关于我们的窃窃私语活动。正如您可能猜到的那样，我不太喜欢扁平化管理；我不太喜欢扁平化管理。它让混蛋们隐藏虐待行为，因为没有责任链。

Descriptions of any flat management studio from people who’ve worked there and reports on their efficacy indicate that without a proper managerial framework, cliques form. The science on this appears to agree, from what I’ve read so far (I’m studying this topic because I want to do what’s best for my employees). In a flat structure system, if you’re in the clique, you’re good. If you’re not, you’re out. If you make them lots of money, you get to keep your job, so people tend to work on the things that are guaranteed to work.  
曾在扁平化管理工作室工作过的人对扁平化管理工作室的描述以及其功效报告表明，如果没有适当的管理框架，就会形成派系。从我到目前为止所读到的内容来看，这方面的科学似乎是一致的（我正在研究这个主题，因为我想为我的员工做最好的事情）。在扁平结构系统中，如果你属于小集团，那你就很好。如果你不是，那你就出局了。如果你给他们赚了很多钱，你就可以保住工作，所以人们倾向于做那些有保证的事情。

Valve _should_ be the studio taking the most risks because risks don’t hurt them at all, but all the news we have from the inside, as exemplified by the PC Gamer article, indicates that they shy away from risk to make sure that they’re considered making valuable contributions to the company.  
Valve 应该是冒最大风险的工作室，因为风险根本不会伤害他们，但我们从内部得到的所有消息，正如《PC Gamer》文章所例证的那样，表明他们回避风险，以确保他们“重新考虑为公司做出宝贵贡献。

> One of the most interesting ways you could see it seeping in was when people specifically did riskier projects near the beginning of the year,” a former Valve employee told People Make Games. “And then they’d go back to the more well-known ones as it gets closer to review time because recency bias would make people focus on that stuff.  
> 你可以看到它渗透的最有趣的方式之一是当人们在年初专门做风险较高的项目时，”一位前 Valve 员工告诉 People Make Games。 “然后，当接近审核时间时，他们会回到更知名的内容，因为新近度偏差会让人们关注那些东西。

When McNamara was told he wasn’t considering what the people he was literally bombing may have felt about his actions, he wrote that down, then erased it, and said that since the feelings of the Vietnamese people couldn’t be measured, they didn’t matter.  
当麦克纳马拉被告知他没有考虑他所轰炸的人们对他的行为可能有什么感受时，他写下了这一点，然后擦掉了它，并说由于越南人民的感受无法衡量，所以他们没有这样做。没关系。

In Hearts and Minds, the best Documentary on the Vietnam War that I’ve ever seen, the most heartwrenching scene occurs near the end, when a farmer is grieving, breaking down at the misery inflicted upon him.  
在我看过的关于越南战争的最好的纪录片《人心与思想》中，最令人心碎的场景发生在接近尾声时，一位农民因所遭受的苦难而悲痛欲绝。

“Take it back to the United States,” a farmer pleads, “tell them what happened. My daughter is dead.”  
“把它带回美国，”一位农民恳求道，“告诉他们发生了什么事。我女儿死了。”

“I can’t measure it,” said McNamara, “so it must not be important.”  
“我无法衡量它，”麦克纳马拉说，“所以它一定不重要。”

Fuck you, McNamara. May you and Kissinger burn forever.  
去你妈的，麦克纳马拉。愿你和基辛格永远燃烧。

Now, obviously, I’m not saying that what Valve does is as bad as the Vietnam War, but I think… when I look at every business that does this, and I look at the human cost, every person who loses their job, who suffers, all because people are saying “if I can’t _easily measure it_, it must not matter,” then I think… I think we can at least learn from the most extreme example. This is how bad it can get if unchecked. Do I think Valve will firebomb children? No. I do not. Do I think the entire industry — all of us — could prosper if Valve handled things differently? Oh yeah, absolutely.  
现在，显然，我并不是说 Valve 所做的事情和越南战争一样糟糕，但我认为……当我看看每一个这样做的企业，我看看人力成本，每个失去工作的人，谁受苦，都是因为人们说“如果我不能轻易衡量它，那一定无关紧要”，然后我想……我认为我们至少可以从最极端的例子中学习。如果不加以控制，情况会变得多么糟糕。我认为 Valve 会用燃烧弹攻击儿童吗？不，我不。我认为如果 Valve 采取不同的处理方式，整个行业——我们所有人——都会繁荣吗？哦，是的，绝对是。

This is very much one of those “I think the best way to figure this out would be to actually run an experiment inside of Valve” things but I don’t imagine that Newell and the rest would want to do something so fuckin weird as satisfy my scientific curiosity. They’re making billions every year; why _should_ they change?  
这在很大程度上是“我认为解决这个问题的最好方法是在 Valve 内部实际运行一个实验”的事情之一，但我不认为纽厄尔和其他人会想做一些如此奇怪的事情来满足我的科学好奇心。他们每年赚取数十亿美元；他们为什么要改变？

Metrics are McNamara Fallacied to hell. Money can be _easily measured_, so there’s no reason to try to measure things that can’t be measured, like “what is people’s sentiment around Valve?” or “how can we get people to trust Valve to make quality games?”  
指标是麦克纳马拉的谬论。金钱很容易衡量，所以没有理由去衡量那些无法衡量的东西，比如“人们对 Valve 的看法如何？”或者“我们怎样才能让人们相信 Valve 会制作高质量的游戏？”

So, the way the picture has been painted, repeatedly, over the years, goes like this:  
所以，多年来，这幅画的绘制方式是这样的：

> “I’m told that Valve would almost certainly have shipped more games, not necessarily _better_ ones but definitely _more_, had it adopted a traditional company structure that doesn’t allow employees to walk or roll away from projects as easily,” Bratt says. “But ultimately Steam’s success has meant Valve’s income has not been dependent on the next game it ships in a very long time.”  
> “我听说，如果 Valve 采用不允许员工轻易离开项目的传统公司结构，那么几乎肯定会推出更多游戏，不一定是更好的游戏，但肯定会更多，”布拉特说。 “但最终 Steam 的成功意味着 Valve 的收入在很长一段时间内不再依赖于它发布的下一款游戏。”

I said something [similar](https://kotaku.com/why-well-never-see-half-life-3-1786170872) when I wrote an article initially titled “Why We’ll Never See Half Life 3” but then some dude yelled at me and made me change the title because “if they do make it, Kotaku will look bad.” Well, that was nearly a decade ago, and we’ve still never seen Half-Life 3\. In fact, the core point of my article — that Eli was the primary driver of Half-Life 2’s plot — was sidestepped by Valve telling a story _before_ Eli died.  
当我写一篇最初标题为“为什么我们永远看不到《半条命 3》”的文章时，我也说过类似的话，但后来有人对我大喊大叫，让我改变标题，因为“如果他们真的成功了，Kotaku 就会看起来很糟糕。”好吧，那是近十年前的事了，我们还从未看过《半条命 3》。事实上，我文章的核心观点——伊莱是《半条命 2》情节的主要推动者——被 Valve 回避了，他告诉我以利死前的故事。

I explained it like this: the reason narrative mod projects almost never ship and competitive mod projects ship a lot is because competitive products are fairly easy to make without a lot of leadership. People can just kinda do whatever they want. Make this or that weapon, asset, level, and people will make it work. As long as you understand the core rules of the game, that’s easy.  
我是这样解释的：叙事模组项目几乎从不发货而竞争性模组项目大量发货的原因是，有竞争力的产品在没有大量领导力的情况下相当容易制作。人们可以做任何他们想做的事。制作这个或那个武器、资产、等级，然后人员就会让它发挥作用。只要你了解游戏的核心规则，那就很容易了。

At corporate scale, you get Valve, a company that no longer makes the classics like Portal and Half-Life. Instead, Valve only really has competitive games where the creative heavy lifting was done by the mod teams (Valve’s big three games: Dota 2, Team Fortress 2, and Counterstrike 2, are all games that fans initially created themselves, and Valve picked up and turned into commercial products) and those pair _really well_ with Valve’s management structure.  
在公司规模上，你会看到 Valve，一家不再制作《传送门》和《半条命》等经典游戏的公司。相反，Valve 只有真正的竞技游戏，其中的创意重任是由模组团队完成的（Valve 的三大游戏：Dota 2、Team Fortress 2 和 Counterstrike 2，都是粉丝最初自己创作的游戏，Valve 挑选并开发了这些游戏）变成了商业产品），这些与 Valve 的管理结构非常匹配。

Every new idea we hear about — Stars of Blood, for instance — dies, canceled and forgotten, because making projects is extremely hard work, and it’s much easier to work on a project where you have the ‘rules’ laid out and you’re just building content for it, which is why Valve is more known by some as “the studio that makes hats” than a studio that makes games.  
我们听到的每一个新想法——例如《血之星》——都会消亡、取消和遗忘，因为制作项目是一项极其艰苦的工作，而在制定了“规则”并且你可以在项目中工作会容易得多。只是为其构建内容，这就是为什么 Valve 被一些人称为“制作帽子的工作室”而不是制作游戏的工作室。

Through its management structure, it appears Valve optimized itself out of making anything other than multiplayer games. When we get the occasional “Aperture Science test game for Steam Deck or VR” or Half-Life Alyx… they don’t really do much for the industry anymore. It’s Valve using its existing branding to try and advertise other things — notably hardware.  
通过其管理结构，Valve 似乎优化了自己，不再制作多人游戏以外的任何游戏。当我们偶尔看到“Steam Deck 或 VR 的 Aperture Science 测试游戏”或《半条命 Alyx》时……它们已经不再为行业做出太多贡献了。 Valve 利用其现有的品牌来尝试宣传其他东西——尤其是硬件。

(Also, just throwing this out there: let’s say you’re working at Valve and you see hate speech. You start banning people. Well, that’s costing Valve money, right? Someone at Valve might suggest you’re a negative value add to the company. You can’t really measure how many people are driven away by hate speech being on your store, but you can measure customers who you boot, right? It’s _hard_ to measure, but I have seen data that indicates that yes, in fact, chasing bigots away actually makes you more money overall. But how do you prove that? It’s very hard!)  
（另外，只是把这个扔出去：假设你在 Valve 工作，你看到了仇恨言论。你开始禁止人们。好吧，这会花费 Valve 的钱，对吗？ Valve 的某人可能会认为你是一个负值增值者你无法真正衡量有多少人因为商店里的仇恨言论而被赶走，但你可以衡量你引导的客户，对吧？这很难衡量，但我看到的数据表明，是的，在事实上，赶走顽固分子实际上可以让你赚更多的钱，但是你如何证明这一点呢？）

Some people argued with me; they said “but Valve does VR, Valve does the Steam Deck. That’s innovation! You can’t argue with that!”  
有人与我争论；他们说：“但是 Valve 做 VR，Valve 做 Steam Deck。这就是创新！你无法反驳这一点！”

Fuck yeah, dude, and I love that shit. Again, I am discussing issues I see that may be harming Valve. I am doing this not to shit on Valve, but because man, I’d love to talk to Gabe Newell about this and see if there are ways we could actually make Valve a better place. I _like_ Valve again, remember? I’d love to ship a game with Source 2\. There’s a lot of amazing people at the studio!  
他妈的，是的，老兄，我喜欢那个狗屎。我再次讨论我认为可能损害 Valve 的问题。我这样做并不是为了攻击 Valve，而是因为我很想和 Gabe Newell 谈谈这件事，看看是否有办法让 Valve 变得更好。我又喜欢Valve了，还记得吗？我很想用 Source 2 发布一款游戏。工作室里有很多很棒的人！

I envision a world where Valve is living up to its full potential, and it excites me. I want that! I want to see a Valve that’s _successful_. And they are successful, because they have Steam, but I want to see all that massive potential that’s just sitting there making profitable multiplayer games _try_ the kind of things that attracted talent like Viktor Antonov or Kim Swift in the first place.  
我设想了一个 Valve 充分发挥其潜力的世界，这让我兴奋不已。我要那个！我希望看到 Valve 取得成功。他们之所以成功，是因为他们拥有 Steam，但我希望看到所有巨大的潜力，这些潜力只是坐在那里，制作有利可图的多人游戏，尝试那些首先吸引 Viktor Antonov 或 Kim Swift 等人才的事情。

And… well, that’s the thing. Valve has fallen into the Blizzard trap of “we’ll release it when we’re ready,” but Blizzard is more a game developer than a storefront; and they’ve been fallling apart, their games suffering, fanbase suffering, _employees suffering_ — because of this approach. Blizzard _can’t_ do it, and Valve can only because they never have to worry about running out of money. Is it actually _good_ for Valve? How do you measure it?  
而且……好吧，就是这样。 Valve 陷入了“我们准备好后就会发布它”的暴雪陷阱，但暴雪更多的是一家游戏开发商，而不是一家店面；由于这种方法，他们一直在分崩离析，他们的游戏受到影响，粉丝群体受到影响，员工受到影响。暴雪做不到，Valve能做只是因为他们永远不用担心没钱。这对 Valve 真的有好处吗？你如何衡量它？

Valve has Steam. Valve gets 1/3 of every game that goes through there, and they make, I guarantee you, _millions_ every single day.  
阀门有蒸汽。 Valve 获得了每场游戏的 1/3，我向你保证，他们每天赚到数百万美元。

So Valve can sit there, and they can claim they’re following the data and McNamara Fallacying the whole time. Valve can go for years without new game releases because the games _might_ make money, but Steam _will_ keep them going.  
所以 Valve 可以坐在那里，他们可以声称自己一直在跟踪数据，而麦克纳马拉谬论。 Valve 可以多年不发布新游戏，因为这些游戏可能会赚钱，但 Steam 会让它们继续下去。

You cannot be like that guy who tried to take over the game project I was on and say “emulate Valve.”  
你不能像那个试图接管我参与的游戏项目并说“效仿 Valve”的人一样。

Valve is… like Destiny. Destiny is a game that is wildly successful (or was, until they started datafucking it to death), but every other game that copies Destiny’s loot system dies a horrible death. Why? Because that loot system hurts Destiny too (it was the core reason of a massive exodus a few years back), but Destiny has other reasons that it’s successful. It’s the monkey on Destiny’s back, not an asset. Everyone who copies that design fails.  
Valve ……就像《命运》。 《命运》是一款非常成功的游戏（或者说，在他们开始将其数据搞砸之前），但所有其他复制《命运》战利品系统的游戏都惨遭失败。为什么？因为这种战利品系统也伤害了《命运》（这是几年前大规模外流的核心原因），但《命运》的成功还有其他原因。这是命运背上的猴子，而不是资产。每个复制该设计的人都失败了。

And if you copy Valve, you will die too, because _you don’t have Steam_.  
如果你抄袭Valve，你也会死，因为你没有Steam。

Like we said before, that’s why Valve’s getting into hardware. It’s smart business; Valve wants to be the first to market in VR and handhelds too. Become the default so that all the purchases pass through you and you get a cut.  
正如我们之前所说，这就是 Valve 进军硬件领域的原因。这是明智的生意； Valve 也希望成为第一个进入 VR 和手持设备市场的公司。成为默认，这样所有的购买都会经过你，你就能得到提成。

Make so much money that you can fail forever and never have to worry a day in your life. Waste all the potential you’ve got to make amazing things because you don’t have to worry about quality.  
赚很多钱，你可以永远失败，而一生中永远不用担心。浪费你所有的潜力来创造令人惊叹的东西，因为你不必担心质量。

Blizzard and Valve have both, at various times, had employees say the secret to their success is that they will spend lots of time trying to find the fun. The reality is, they have lots of money and will make games that are a lot like what other people are doing, but with way more polish because they had a _very big warchest_ full of money to ensure they can keep developing stuff.  
暴雪和 Valve 都有员工在不同时期表示，他们成功的秘诀在于他们会花大量时间去寻找乐趣。现实是，他们有很多钱，并且会制作与其他人正在做的游戏非常相似的游戏，但会更加精致，因为他们有一个非常大的资金来确保他们可以继续开发东西。

As you’ll notice, as soon as both studios started saying they _could_ do that… they did… and stopped shipping games. And when they did, sure, sometimes those games do pretty well, but… it’s certainly not the games that built the _brand_.  
正如您所注意到的，一旦两家工作室开始表示他们可以做到这一点……他们就做到了……并停止发行游戏。当然，当他们这样做时，有时这些游戏会做得很好，但是……这肯定不是建立品牌的游戏。

“We’ll release it when we’re ready” is a thing I’ve heard big studios that succeeded say, but they always say that after a project that had actual deadlines shipped, on a project that had those actual deadlines.  
“当我们准备好时，我们会发布它”是我听过成功的大型工作室说过的话，但他们总是说，在一个有实际截止日期的项目之后，在一个有这些实际截止日期的项目上。

Then, invariably, the team that does that wastes inordinate amounts of time polishing games with no significant benefit, and the game comes out on the strength of the game that shipped on a deadline (Diablo 2) and the game that releases — the “we’ll ship it when it’s ready” game — ends up a mess that needs rebooting (Diablo 3). It’s a fantasy, a post-hoc explanation for success that isn’t actually true. Shipping on deadlines works. “We’ll get to it one day” rarely results in a game that matters to the players.  
然后，这样做的团队总是会浪费大量的时间来打磨游戏，而没有带来任何显着的好处，而游戏的诞生取决于在截止日期前发布的游戏（《暗黑破坏神 2》）和发布的游戏——“我们“准备好后就会发布”游戏 - 结果一团糟，需要重新启动（暗黑破坏神 3）。这是一种幻想，是对成功的事后解释，实际上并不正确。按期限发货是有效的。 “有一天我们会做到这一点”很少会带来一款对玩家来说很重要的游戏。

Would any of Valve’s big multiplayer games be big if they didn’t have Steam? Hard to say. Steam is built to funnel players into playing those games. Steam gives those games advertising space that other games don’t get. Nothing wrong with that — it’s their store and their right — but it does mean it’s difficult to tell if just making identical games that aren’t on Steam would give that level of traffic.  
如果没有 Steam，Valve 的大型多人游戏还会大吗？很难说。 Steam 的建立就是为了引导玩家玩这些游戏。 Steam 为这些游戏提供了其他游戏无法获得的广告空间。这并没有什么错——这是他们的商店，也是他们的权利——但这确实意味着很难判断仅仅制作 Steam 上没有的相同游戏是否会带来那么高的流量。

Nothing can hurt Valve, so Valve can make as many mistakes as it wants. It can McNamara Fallacy itself to death, and it can never really die, because too much money courses through it, because it is, in fact, the best store out there.  
没有什么可以伤害 Valve，所以 Valve 可以犯很多错误。它可以把麦克纳马拉谬论本身消灭掉，但它永远不会真正消亡，因为太多的钱流经它，因为它实际上是最好的商店。

It’s not really possible to compete.  
确实不可能竞争。

So, if you want to datafuck your way through this McNamara bullshit, you can, but to do it, _you have to have a way to never, ever fail_.  
所以，如果你想通过数据操弄麦克纳马拉的废话，你可以，但要做到这一点，你必须有一种永远不会失败的方法。

One person responded to a twitter thread of mine saying “well, you could just make a new Steam.” I said that would be impossible. They said something like “nah, you’d just have to have all the features that 20 years of R&D provides, you’d have to be able to import everyone’s existing library and saves to Steam…” and in their second tweet, they started faltering. So I gently asked them “realizing it’s impossible, right?” They went “yeah, if I’d written the third tweet, I would’ve said I get your point now” or something.  
有人回复我的推特帖子说：“好吧，你可以制作一个新的 Steam。”我说那是不可能的。他们说了这样的话：“不，你只需要拥有 20 年研发提供的所有功能，你必须能够导入每个人现有的库并保存到 Steam...”，在他们的第二条推文中，他们开始步履蹒跚。于是我温和地问他们“意识到这是不可能的，对吧？”他们说“是的，如果我写了第三条推文，我会说我现在明白你的意思了”之类的。

It’s not really possible to make a new Amazon.com now. Amazon controls the market. Their business model designs on undercutting you. To get into that space, you need _far more money_ than the $300k that Jeff Bezos took out to grow his company. He had the _timing_ right.  
现在确实不可能创建一个新的亚马逊网站。亚马逊控制着市场。他们的商业模式旨在削弱你的优势。要进入这个领域，你需要的资金远多于杰夫·贝索斯 (Jeff Bezos) 为发展公司而投入的 30 万美元。他的时机恰到好处。

Valve is the same way.  
阀门也是同样的道理。

You cannot _be_ Valve. To be Valve, you have to own Steam. Unless you can own Steam, the McNamara Fallacy will be a problem you face. There’s just no way around it.  
你不能成为 Valve。要成为 Valve，您必须拥有 Steam。除非你能拥有 Steam，否则麦克纳马拉谬论将是你面临的一个问题。没有办法解决这个问题。

Valve focuses a lot on data, like a lot of other companies that aren’t really out there shipping amazing games regularly. Valve gets to do that because they have Steam. Blizzard got so top heavy that Microsoft bought it and had to kill yet another one of their “we spent more than half a decade on this game with no end in sight” projects. Blizzard’s most successful new IP was just a direct rip of Team Fortress 2 after the much more ambitious Project Titan died.  
Valve 非常注重数据，就像许多其他公司一样，它们并没有定期发布精彩的游戏。 Valve 之所以能做到这一点，是因为他们有 Steam。暴雪变得头重脚轻，以至于微软买下了它，并不得不终止他们的另一个“我们在这款游戏上花费了五年多的时间，而且看不到尽头”的项目。暴雪最成功的新 IP 只不过是在雄心勃勃的泰坦计划消亡后直接撕毁了《军团要塞 2》。

Bioware’s in the same boat, a once-legendary studio with an insane run of Baldur’s Gate II, Neverwinter Nights, Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age… and then they started hiring fans, started doubling down on their worst tendencies… and you can see the cracks start to form.  
Bioware 也有同样的情况，一家曾经的传奇工作室，推出了《博德之门 II》、《无冬之夜》、《旧共和国武士》、《翡翠帝国》、《质量效应》和《龙腾世纪》……然后他们开始招募粉丝，开始加倍投入他们最糟糕的倾向……你可以看到裂缝开始形成。

Mass Effect 2 feels good until you realize the plot’s a loose rip of The Dirty Dozen (right down to the fact that there was an extra room on the ship for the final character in the ‘dozen,’ Kasumi, a DLC character) and the cutscenes are shot-for-shot rips from JJ Abrams’ Star Trek 2009\. The writing takes a nosedive — the people leading Mass Effect like Drew Karpyshyn were working on The Old Republic, an MMO that… really, really struggled on launch — and then Dragon Age 2 releases in a _disastrous state_. Mass Effect 3 was… okay, but had an ending so bad that gamers pressured Bioware to literally rewrite the ending in an expansion.  
质量效应 2 感觉很好，直到你意识到情节是《十二十二人》的松散撕裂（事实上，船上有一个额外的空间容纳“十二人”中的最后一个角色，霞，一个 DLC 角色）和过场动画是 J·J·艾布拉姆斯 2009 年的《星际迷航》中的逐镜头剪辑。剧本的写作急转直下——像德鲁·卡皮辛这样领导《质量效应》的人正在制作《旧共和国》，这是一款 MMO，在发行时……真的非常艰难——然后《龙腾世纪 2》的发行处于灾难性的状态。 《质量效应 3》……还不错，但结局太糟糕了，玩家迫使 Bioware 在资料片中重写了结局。

Dragon Age Inquisition sold extremely well, but… Dragon Age 4 has entirely fallen apart, people like Laidlaw, Knowles, and Gaider are gone. Mass Effect Andromeda was a fucking mess (talking to someone who was working on the gameplay at the time, a few months before ship, he told me “we should have never used Frostbite, man”), and Anthem was a disaster (that, hey, copied Bungie’s loot system! Like I said, no game that copies that system succeeds because nobody else is making gameplay on par with what Bungie can do).  
《龙腾世纪审判》卖得非常好，但是……《龙腾世纪4》已经完全崩溃了，像雷德洛、诺尔斯和盖德这样的人都消失了。 《质量效应仙女座》真是一团糟（在发布前几个月，与当时正在开发游戏的人交谈，他告诉我“我们不应该使用霜冻，伙计”），而《圣歌》则是一场灾难（那，嘿，复制了 Bungie 的战利品系统！就像我说的，复制该系统的游戏都不会成功，因为没有其他人能够制作出与 Bungie 同等的游戏玩法）。

It went from a studio constantly making new, amazing things to a studio that just. Kept. Making. The Same. Things. And they started losing the experts who knew how to make things and started bringing in people whose job it was to simply make more of the thing.  
它从一个不断创造新的、令人惊奇的东西的工作室变成了一个仅仅创造新的、令人惊奇的东西的工作室。保留。制作。相同。事物。他们开始失去知道如何制造东西的专家，并开始引进那些工作只是制造更多东西的人。

They didn’t let their fields lie fallow. They datafucked themselves to death.  
他们没有让自己的田地休耕。他们把自己数据搞死了。

## I can(’t) tell you how to make it  
我不能告诉你怎么做

No matter what I do, how hard I try, it all comes back to this: a lot of people got into the business to do the business. They found the numbers that were easy to follow, easy to measure, and they started chasing that. They bred snakes to make snake-death bounties, but the result was just creating more snakes than ever.  
无论我做什么，无论我多么努力，一切都会回到这一点：很多人进入这个行业是为了做生意。他们发现了易于遵循、易于测量的数字，并开始追逐它。他们饲养蛇是为了获得蛇死亡赏金，但结果只是创造了比以往更多的蛇。

Boeing killed more people than Timothy McVeigh. Bob Iger and David Zaslav are destroying Disney and Warner Bros. Valve has stopped innovating at making games, instead preferring to find new ways to make more money because that’s apparently how you keep your job there. Blizzard basically only exists because Microsoft saved their ass by buying them out and because of their old WoW Warchest.  
波音公司造成的死亡人数比蒂莫西·麦克维还多。鲍勃·艾格 (Bob Iger) 和大卫·扎斯拉夫 (David Zaslav) 正在摧毁迪士尼和华纳兄弟。 Valve 已经停止了游戏制作方面的创新，而是更愿意寻找新的方法来赚更多钱，因为这显然是保住饭碗的方法。暴雪的存在基本上只是因为微软通过收购他们的股份来拯救他们，以及他们的旧魔兽世界战箱。

At Naughty Dog, before The Last of Us II released, a senior animator who’d recently left (and they tried to violate labor law by withholding his final check because they were trying to make him sign shit he didn’t have to sign) said “a more senior team would have shipped this game a year ago.”  
在顽皮狗，在《最后生还者 II》发行之前，一位最近离开的高级动画师（他们试图通过扣留他的最终支票来违反劳动法，因为他们试图让他签署他不必签署的东西）说“一个更资深的团队一年前就会推出这款游戏。”

With all the news lately about how Sony’s development practices [aren’t sustainable](https://www.gamesradar.com/not-sustainable-developers-across-the-industry-react-to-the-last-of-us-part-2s-dollar220-million-budget/#:~:text=%22Not%20sustainable%22%3A%20Developers%20across,2's%20%24220%20million%20budget%20%7C%20GamesRadar%2B) because of insane costs, it’s ridiculous to hear that inept fuckwits like Neil Druckmann are going around demanding changes and barely managing to put together games with bloated budgets and ridiculous timelines.  
最近有很多关于索尼的开发实践由于疯狂的成本而无法持续的新闻，听到像尼尔·德鲁克曼这样的无能傻瓜到处要求改变，却几乎无法将预算臃肿和时间表荒唐的游戏整合在一起，这真是荒谬。

I heard nothing but nightmares about working at 343, largely due to management’s lack of respect for what few employees it did have. Someone told me a name management had for its contractors. I can’t remember what it was now, but it was derogatory. That shouldn’t happen. Jesus Christ, that shouldn’t happen.  
我只听到关于在 343 工作的噩梦，这主要是因为管理层对公司仅有的少数员工缺乏尊重。有人告诉我管理层为其承包商起了一个名字。我现在不记得那是什么了，但那是贬义的。那不应该发生。天哪，这不应该发生。

A common refrain in every failure, from Marvel to Warner Brothers to Boeing, was this: “Leadership doesn’t know what they want,” and “leadership doesn’t trust the people who know what they’re doing to do their jobs.” It’s a deadly combination — people who try to use easy data to justify making decisions when they don’t know the first thing about a product, because they’re too busy numberfucking and datafucking to try to make number bigger, results in every one of these companies getting worse.  
从漫威到华纳兄弟再到波音，每一次失败的共同点是：“领导层不知道他们想要什么”，并且“领导层不信任那些知道自己在做什么的人来完成他们的工作。 ”这是一个致命的组合——人们在不了解产品的第一件事时试图使用简单的数据来证明决策的合理性，因为他们太忙于数字和数据，无暇尝试让数字变得更大，结果是：这些公司的情况越来越糟。

It’s not that games are _worse_, it’s that leadership _fucking sucks_.  
并不是游戏更糟糕，而是领导力太糟糕了。

Jimmy McNerney got one thing right: there is an issue with not enough leadership, but the problem is, these fuckers think that having the position is what makes you a leader, not _doing the actual leadership_.  
吉米·麦克纳尼（Jimmy McNerney）做对了一件事：领导力不足是个问题，但问题是，这些混蛋认为只有拥有这个职位才能成为领导者，而不是真正发挥领导作用。

Fun fact, a long while ago, Boeing actually did a study, and they found that it takes _four years_ for a new hire to get up to speed. Four years. Granted, making an airliner is one of the most difficult tasks in human history, but still, it takes _time_.  
有趣的是，很久以前，波音公司实际上做了一项研究，他们发现新员工需要四年的时间才能适应新的情况。四年。诚然，制造客机是人类历史上最困难的任务之一，但这仍然需要时间。

One of the worst guys I ever knew in games, a big famous wholesome games guy who hated disabled people, once told me that I should never hire any employees. Just contractors. Change ’em ever project, that way we could cut costs.  
我在游戏界认识的最糟糕的人之一，一位著名的健康游戏人，讨厌残疾人，他曾经告诉我，我永远不应该雇用任何员工。只是承包商。改变他们的项目，这样我们就可以削减成本。

His games… don’t really make money, and their reviews aren’t so great outside of the people he’s conned into thinking he made a bunch of original ideas (they’re mostly pitches other people made while he was in the room. I know because five of them are mine). He sees people as machines that build programs for him to make a profit off of. He’d read an article about a guy who made a ton of little arcade games and he figured, hey, if I can just pay people to do that for me, I can keep growing until I have a hundred games on Steam all making me a little bit of money. Maybe I can make a hundred grand a year.  
他的游戏……并没有真正赚钱，而且除了他欺骗的那些认为他提出了一堆原创想法的人之外，他们的评论也不是那么好（这些想法大多是他在房间里时其他人提出的。我知道，因为其中五个是我的）。他将人视为机器，为他构建程序并从中获利。他读过一篇关于一个制作了大量小型街机游戏的人的文章，他想，嘿，如果我可以花钱请人为我做这些，我就可以继续成长，直到我在 Steam 上拥有一百个游戏，这一切都让我感到高兴。一点点钱。也许我一年能赚一百块。

Me? I’m talking to people about _millions_ of dollars for my next projects. Why? Because I keep people around, I help build their expertise, I make sure we share our knowledge, I am building a _cohesive unit_.  
我？我正在和人们讨论为我的下一个项目投入数百万美元。为什么？因为我留住了人们，我帮助他们培养专业知识，我确保我们分享我们的知识，我正在建立一个有凝聚力的团队。

Because that’s the secret of it all. You may not be able to measure it, but… I mean, you read [my piece](https://docseuss.medium.com/a-lot-of-people-think-auteur-theory-is-bad-but-the-truth-is-way-way-funnier-than-they-realize-c7d491f846ff) on auteur theory, right? While guys like Bob Iger actively try to get the press to argue against it and claim that valorizing one specific person is a bad idea — you’ll note auteur theory never applies to people like Bob, only creatives, and I mentioned Bob literally shit talking creatives here, claiming you need more execs to babysit them, even though all the information we have shows that the fewer executives involved, the better — but if you actually _read_ about auteur theory, do you know what you learn?  
因为这就是一切的秘密。你可能无法衡量它，但是……我的意思是，你读过我关于作者理论的文章，​​对吗？虽然像鲍勃·艾格这样的人积极地试图让媒体反对它，并声称评价一个特定的人是一个坏主意，但你会注意到作者理论从来不适用于像鲍勃这样的人，只适用于创意人员，我提到鲍勃确实是在胡言乱语。这里的创意人员，声称你需要更多的高管来照顾他们，尽管我们掌握的所有信息都表明，高管参与得越少越好，但如果你真正阅读了作者理论，你知道你学到了什么吗？

You learn that auteur theory is a response to a question, which is “why can I recognize certain artists in their work?” and the answer to that question, at least, the one auteur theory provides, is this:  
你会了解到作者理论是对一个问题的回答，这个问题是“为什么我能在某些艺术家的作品中认出他们？”至少，单一作者理论提供的这个问题的答案是：

You can recognize an artist because they like certain topics and because _they tend to work with the same people_.  
您可以认出一位艺术家，因为他们喜欢某些主题，并且他们倾向于与同一个人合作。

You see, an auteur is an organizing force, an _actual leader_, and one people _like_ to follow. Until she died from heatstroke on a hike, Sally Menke edited every one of Quentin Tarantino’s films. Thelma Schoonmaker edits all of Martin Scorsese’s. I’m not a big fan of him, but Chris Nolan tends to work with a lot of the same actors _because they like working with him_.  
你看，导演是一种组织力量，一个真正的领导者，一个人们喜欢追随的人。莎莉·门克 (Sally Menke) 剪辑了昆汀·塔伦蒂诺 (Quentin Tarantino) 的每一部电影，直到她在一次徒步旅行中中暑去世。塞尔玛·斯库梅克 (Thelma Schoonmaker) 剪辑了马丁·斯科塞斯 (Martin Scorsese) 的所有作品。我不是他的忠实粉丝，但克里斯·诺兰倾向于与很多相同的演员合作，因为他们喜欢与他合作。

An auteur is a person _people like to work with_, because the auteur treats them well and _leads them well_. An auteur is both leader _and expert_. “Leadership” isn’t a role, it’s a _task that must be performed_, and guys like Iger and McNerney aren’t fuckin’ doing that shit, which is why I think McNerney and every Boeing CEO since has more blood on his hands than just about anyone alive today.  
导演是人们喜欢合作的人，因为导演对他们很好，对他们领导也很好。导演既是领导者又是专家。 “领导力”不是一个角色，而是一项必须执行的任务，像艾格和麦克纳尼这样的人他妈的不会做那种事，这就是为什么我认为麦克纳尼和此后的每一位波音首席执行官手上沾满的鲜血都比他们多。几乎所有今天还活着的人。

James Scott, the director of agrarian studies at Yale, a specialist in things like “why humans do shit” and how domesticating grain is why we have last names (it’s a long story, that’s what the book Against the Grain is about), told a story in one of his books about how a bunch of European scientists went to Africa.  
耶鲁大学农业研究主任詹姆斯·斯科特（James Scott）是“人类为何拉屎”以及驯化谷物如何成为我们姓氏等问题的专家（这是一个很长的故事，这就是《反对谷物》一书的内容），他告诉我们他的一本书中讲述了一群欧洲科学家如何前往非洲的故事。

The scientists said “hey, we know more than you. We have the data, the intellectual property, whatever. We know that if you put plants like this, you can grow effectively.”  
科学家们说：“嘿，我们比你知道得更多。我们拥有数据、知识产权等等。我们知道，如果你放置这样的植物，你就能有效地生长。”

The African farmers, who knew their biomes and microclimates much better than the scientists, said “that won’t work.” The Europeans forced them to do it the European way.  
非洲农民比科学家更了解他们的生物群落和小气候，他们说“这是行不通的”。欧洲人强迫他们按照欧洲的方式去做。

The farms all failed. 农场都失败了。

Why? Well, as it turned out, the plants in Africa that the farmers had been growing had symbiotic relationships. The little ones grew really well at the roots of the big ones, and somehow — it’s been a few years since I read this — faciliated the growth of the big ones too. Some soil exchange shit if I recall correctly.  
为什么？事实证明，非洲农民种植的植物具有共生关系。小树在大树的根部生长得很好，不知何故——自从我读到这篇文章已经有几年了——也促进了大树的生长。如果我没记错的话，有些土壤交换了。

The Europeans more or less wanted “more farmland to make things we can ship back home.” There was no market for the African plants. But the African plants were suited to that climate, and the European plants were not. The arrogance of the scientists, presuming they had the data, led to a McNamara Fallacy Event of disastrous proportions.  
欧洲人或多或少想要“更多的农田来生产我们可以运回家的东西。”非洲植物没有市场。但非洲植物适合这种气候，而欧洲植物则不适合。科学家们的傲慢自以为拥有数据，导致了灾难性的麦克纳马拉谬误事件。

(Scott talks a lot about how people like to use grids to organize and control structures that might not best be organized in grids. But it’s really good for collecting tax revenue)  
（斯科特谈了很多关于人们如何喜欢使用网格来组织和控制可能不适合在网格中组织的结构。但这对于征收税收确实有好处）

That article I linked at the start of this piece? [Suicide Mission](https://prospect.org/infrastructure/transportation/2024-03-28-suicide-mission-boeing/)? It describes a similar situation:  
我在本文开头链接的那篇文章？自杀任务？它描述了类似的情况：

> Boeing had come under the spell of a seductive new theory of “knowledge” that essentially reduced the whole concept to a combination of intellectual property, trade secrets, and data, discarding “thought” and “understanding” and “complex reasoning” possessed by a skilled and experienced workforce as essentially not worth the increased health care costs.  
> 波音公司受到了一种诱人的新“知识”理论的迷惑，该理论本质上将整个概念简化为知识产权、商业秘密和数据的组合，抛弃了知识所拥有的“思想”、“理解”和“复杂推理”。熟练且经验丰富的劳动力基本上不值得增加的医疗保健费用。

All of these people chased the data. They said “we don’t need anyone, we’re playing a different game” because they were.  
所有这些人都在追逐数据。他们说“我们不需要任何人，我们正在玩不同的游戏”，因为他们是。

It’s… a bit like destroying your manufacturing facilities in an RTS so you only have the high-level facilities that manufacture more expensive goods. It sounds like a great idea at first, getting more of your land back so you can use it to build more advanced facilities… but… then you run out of the materials needed to build the expensive shit.  
这……有点像在即时战略游戏中摧毁你的制造设施，这样你就只能拥有制造更昂贵商品的高级设施。乍一看，这听起来是个好主意，拿回更多的土地，这样你就可以用它来建造更先进的设施……但是……然后你就用完了建造昂贵的东西所需的材料。

Short term, number go up. This is good. Long term… you run out of shit to build. Planes fall out of skies, people stop using your service because you keep making eight episode shows. The shows get worse, less entertaining, less desirable because now that the shows are reduced cost, you’re not giving writers chances [to grow into being showrunners](https://www.vice.com/en/article/epxeze/television-is-in-a-showrunning-crisis), a massive crisis facing Hollywood right now. If you have no showrunners, you have no _actual_ leadership — the people who do the actual job, not executives.  
短期来看，数字会上升。这很好。从长远来看……你已经没有什么可建造的了。飞机从天上掉下来，人们停止使用你的服务，因为你一直在制作八集节目。节目变得更糟，娱乐性越来越低，越来越不受欢迎，因为现在节目的成本降低了，你不再给编剧成长为节目主持人的机会，这是好莱坞目前面临的巨大危机。如果没有制片人，就没有真正的领导力——那些做实际工作的人，而不是高管。

David Simon, of The Wire, one of the greatest television shows ever made, a show that _made_ HBO what it is today, [had this to say](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1177569966):  
《火线》是有史以来最伟大的电视节目之一，它造就了 HBO 的今天，其大卫·西蒙 (David Simon) 说道：

> SIMON: Of course. I can entice somebody who is a good writer, who knows how to write dialogue and move pages and can write for a television show that is complex and sophisticated and, you know, can sustain itself narratively over 12 episodes, if I can offer them some decent employment. But if a studio comes to me and says, look, we’re just going to have a mini room, you know…  
> 西蒙：当然。我可以吸引一个优秀的作家，他知道如何写对话和移动页面，可以为一个复杂而精巧的电视节目写作，你知道，可以在 12 集以上的故事中维持自己的叙述，如果我能为他们提供一些体面的就业。但如果一个工作室来找我说，看，我们只会有一个迷你房间，你知道……
> 
> SHAPIRO: People might not be familiar with the term mini room. Explain that.  
> 夏皮罗：人们可能不熟悉迷你房间这个词。解释一下。
> 
> SIMON: The preproduction room that might go six or eight or 10 weeks or maybe only three weeks. And they say, give us all your ideas and, oh, by the way, then go off on your own and write a script. Or they might not even say write a script ’cause there’s money in the script fee, too. They might say, thanks for your ideas. We’re not hiring you, but thanks for participating in our room. Go with God. Nobody who wants to make a living writing television is going to be able to be sustained that way. You can’t live on three weeks’ salary. That’s what’s happening now. When I came on on “Homicide,” a network show that had 22 episodes, I had 30 weeks of employment. I can live on that. I can have a career. I can actually seriously consider writing television for a living. I offer what’s available on these shorter-run shows now to writers — I can’t sustain them.  
> 西蒙：预制作室可能需要六周、八周或十周，甚至可能只有三周。他们说，把你所有的想法告诉我们，哦，顺便说一句，然后你自己写一个剧本。或者他们甚至可能不会说写剧本，因为剧本费也有钱。他们可能会说，谢谢你的想法。我们不会雇用您，但感谢您参与我们的房间。任天意走。没有一个想靠写电视谋生的人能够以这种方式维持下去。你不能靠三周的工资生活。这就是现在正在发生的事情。当我出演 22 集的网络节目“Homicide”时，我已经工作了 30 周。我可以靠这个生活。我可以有一份事业。我实际上可以认真考虑以写电视为生。我现在向作家们提供这些短期节目中可用的内容——我无法维持它们。
> 
> SHAPIRO: So you’re arguing writers should be paid by the time commitment rather than by the episode.  
> 夏皮罗：所以你认为编剧应该根据投入的时间而不是剧集来获得报酬。
> 
> SIMON: Good news — it’s called term employment, and that is what this strike is about. It’s saying, look, hire people for a certain amount of time to do the work and have them there on set and afterwards in editing when writing is happening. Some of the most fundamental decisions about writing are in editing or in reconceptualizing a scene because you’ve lost a location or because an actor is struggling with a line. That’s writer’s work, and we do it on set. It’s why television was able to get to the place of sophistication that it did.  
> 西蒙：好消息——这就是所谓的定期就业，这就是这次罢工的目的。这就是说，看，雇用人员在一定时间内完成工作，让他们在现场，然后在写作时进行编辑。关于写作的一些最基本的决定是在编辑或重新概念化场景时，因为你失去了一个位置或因为演员在台词上挣扎。这是编剧的工作，我们是在片场完成的。这就是为什么电视能够达到如此复杂的程度。

So you need people, and you need to keep _working_ with those people. Scorsese’s best movie isn’t his first with Thelma Schoonmaker, you know? He keeps getting better, because people are gardens. You have to nurture them, tend to them, help them grow.  
所以你需要人，并且你需要继续与这些人合作。斯科塞斯最好的电影并不是他与塞尔玛·斯库梅克合作的第一部，你知道吗？他不断进步，因为人就是花园。你必须培育他们、照顾他们、帮助他们成长。

You can’t datafuck this, not if you want to succeed.  
如果你想成功，你就不能用数据操蛋。

The only people who can survive repeated failures are the people running platforms and stores. If you aren’t doing that — and it’s impossible for you or I to go into our garage and start a new Apple, because instead of competing with nobody for the personal computer or games console, we’re competing with the biggest, most stable companies in the world, with research and development fortunes that will smother us alive.  
唯一能在一次又一次的失败中生存下来的就是运营平台和商店的人。如果你不这样做，你或我就不可能走进我们的车库并创建一个新的苹果公司，因为我们不是在与任何人竞争个人电脑或游戏机，而是在与最大、最稳定的公司竞争世界上的公司，其研发财富足以让我们窒息。

I want to build a new computer? Tough shit, Apple bought all of TSMC’s chipmaking time, so I can’t even source the chips I need to get started.  
我想组装一台新电脑？糟糕的是，苹果买下了台积电所有的芯片制造时间，所以我什至无法采购我需要的芯片。

There is no such thing as an inherently valuable media property. You cannot simply make a Mass Effect right now and have it make the social and cultural impact that it did back then. It must be one of the best games _ever made_, or it’ll be another Andromeda, viewed as a failure that nearly killed the series, because Andromeda was an attempt to stuff more Mass Effect down the audience’s throat when the audience needed a fucking break.  
不存在本质上有价值的媒体财产。你不能简单地立即制作一个质量效应并让它产生像当时那样的社会和文化影响。它一定是有史以来最好的游戏之一，否则它将成为另一款《仙女座》，被视为几乎杀死了该系列的失败，因为《仙女座》试图在观众需要休息时向观众灌输更多《质量效应》 。

Same thing with Marvel. Unfortunately, Endgame is a really good endpoint (I mean, not really, it’s a shitty movie) for most people. The story feels ‘done.’ There’s very little ache for more. These movies are now making way less than they need to in order to be successful. It’s been ten years — the brand’s time is up. The field must lie fallow. It must recharge.  
漫威也是如此。不幸的是，对于大多数人来说，《终局之战》是一个非常好的终点（我的意思是，不是真的，这是一部糟糕的电影）。这个故事感觉“已经完成了”。几乎没有什么渴望更多。这些电影现在的收入远低于其成功所需的水平。十年过去了——这个品牌的时代到了。田地必须休耕。它必须充电。

It might have gotten additional life if the people who knew how to make it got to make it, but they got sidelined and treated like, well, [dogshit](https://www.vulture.com/article/a-vfx-artist-on-what-its-like-working-for-marvel.html):  
如果那些知道如何制造它的人能够成功的话，它可能会获得更多的生命，但他们却被边缘化并被视为狗屎：

> The other thing with Marvel is it’s famous for asking for lots of changes throughout the process. So you’re already overworked, but then Marvel’s asking for regular changes way in excess of what any other client does. And some of those changes are really major. Maybe a month or two before a movie comes out, Marvel will have us change the entire third act. It has really tight turnaround times. So yeah, it’s just not a great situation all around. One visual-effects house could not finish the number of shots and reshoots Marvel was asking for in time, so Marvel had to give my studio the work. Ever since, that house has effectively been blacklisted from getting Marvel work.  
> 漫威的另一件事是，它以在整个过程中要求大量改变而闻名。所以你已经超负荷工作了，但漫威要求定期改变的方式超出了任何其他客户的要求。其中一些变化确实非常重大。也许电影上映前一两个月，漫威会让我们改变整个第三幕。它的周转时间非常紧迫。所以，是的，这并不是一个很好的情况。一家视觉效果公司无法及时完成漫威要求的镜头和重拍数量，因此漫威不得不将工作交给我的工作室。从那时起，该公司实际上就被列入了禁止漫威作品的黑名单。
> 
> Part of the problem comes from the MCU itself — just the sheer number of movies it has. It sets dates, and it’s very inflexible on those dates; yet it’s quite willing to do reshoots and big changes very close to the dates without shifting them up or down. This is not a new dynamic.  
> 部分问题来自于漫威电影宇宙本身——它拥有的电影数量太多。它设定了日期，而且这些日期非常不灵活；然而，它非常愿意在非常接近日期的情况下进行重新拍摄和重大更改，而不会向上或向下移动它们。这并不是什么新动态。
> 
> I remember going to a presentation by one of the other VFX houses about an early MCU movie_,_ and people were talking about how they were getting “pixel-fucked.” That’s a term we use in the industry when the client will nitpick over every little pixel. Even if you never notice it. A client might say, “This is not exactly what I want,” and you keep working at it. But they have no idea what they want. So they’ll be like, “Can you just try this? Can you just try that?” They’ll want you to change an entire setting, an entire environment, pretty late in a movie.  
> 我记得去听过其他一家视觉特效公司关于一部早期漫威电影宇宙电影的演示，人们在谈论他们是如何变得“像素操”的。当客户对每一个小像素挑剔时，我们在行业中使用这个术语。即使你从来没有注意到它。客户可能会说，“这并不完全是我想要的”，而你就继续努力吧。但他们不知道自己想要什么。所以他们会说，“你能试试这个吗？你能试试吗？他们会希望你在电影后期改变整个场景、整个环境。

Gizmodo presents a [similar problem](https://gizmodo.com/disney-marvel-movies-vfx-industry-nightmare-1849385834):  
Gizmodo 也提出了类似的问题：

> Hector has seen massive sequences scrapped within a week of delivering shots that took two or three weeks to build out. “The entire vision will change completely,” he said. “And I get that. You want your directors to have control of the final product. But from the artists standpoint, you need a direction to go in. And Marvel has this very harsh way of communicating with the vendors where they’re very cynical and very, very rude. As if you should be lucky to be receiving constant revisions and notes from them.”  
> 赫克托发现，在拍摄需要两到三周时间才能完成的镜头后，一周内就有大量镜头被废弃。 “整个愿景将彻底改变，”他说。 “我明白了。您希望您的董事能够控制最终产品。但从艺术家的角度来看，你需要一个方向。漫威与供应商的沟通方式非常严厉，他们非常愤世嫉俗，非常非常粗鲁。好像你应该很幸运能够不断收到他们的修改和注释。”
> 
> Sources also stated that this constant vision shift feels driven by the egomaniacal ability to demand changes and see them acquiesced to, rather than considering the kind of changes that will actually affect the story. “Nobody is holding Marvel accountable,” H said. “So they don’t care. They’re like, ‘Fuck you guys. We can make as many changes as we want and you just have to deliver it.’” These changes can be major: Sam described an incident where an actor was filmed in a practical suit and the studio decided it was the wrong suit. “And you have to replace their entire body and just leave their head in every shot.”  
> 消息人士还表示，这种持续的愿景转变感觉是由要求改变并看到他们默许的自大能力驱动的，而不是考虑实际上会影响故事的改变类型。 “没有人追究漫威的责任，”H 说。 “所以他们不在乎。他们就像是，‘操你们这些家伙。我们可以根据需要进行任意多的更改，而您只需要交付它即可。”这些更改可能是重大的：Sam 描述了一次事件，一名演员穿着实用的西装进行拍摄，而工作室认为这是错误的西装。 “而且你必须更换他们的整个身体，只在每个镜头中留下他们的头。”
> 
> All this is done without adjusting the bottom-line of the bid, which means that studios usually can’t hire more artists during crunch time or else risk that single-digit profit percentage going into the red. Continually asking for adjustments, changes, and edits to the shots is called getting “[pixel-fucked](https://www.vulture.com/article/a-vfx-artist-on-what-its-like-working-for-marvel.html),” because the edits to shots become more and more minute until artists are literally editing a single pixel in a shot and sending it off for re-approval. And every time an artist gets pixel fucked, it usually ends up costing the VFX studios money.  
> 所有这些都是在没有调整出价底线的情况下完成的，这意味着工作室通常无法在关键时刻雇佣更多的艺术家，否则就有可能出现个位数利润率亏损的风险。不断要求对镜头进行调整、更改和编辑被称为“像素操”，因为对镜头的编辑变得越来越精细，直到艺术家真正编辑镜头中的单个像素并将其发送以重新批准。每当艺术家被像素搞砸时，通常都会让视觉特效工作室损失金钱。
> 
> The erratic direction of Marvel movies leads to erratic results. That’s why you see incredibly sharp and realistic VFX work in one scene, and then two minutes later, the VFX work looks choppy and rushed. Because in a lot of cases, it is.  
> 漫威电影不稳定的方向导致了不稳定的结果。这就是为什么你会在一个场景中看到极其清晰和逼真的视觉特效，但两分钟后，视觉特效却显得断断续续、仓促。因为在很多情况下确实如此。

So… what should you do?  
那你该怎么办？

Easy: 简单的：

## Forfeit the game 放弃比赛

before somebody else 在别人之前  
takes you out of the frame   
带你走出框架  
and puts your name to shame  
让你的名字蒙羞  
cover up your face 遮住你的脸  
you can’t run the race  
你无法参加比赛  
the pace is too fast,   
节奏太快，  
you just won’t last 你只是不会坚持下去

Every single section of this article was a linkin park joke. Title and first sentence are lyrics from various Linkin Park songs. I did this because I always try to have a little fun with an article, and my NFT articles were explicitly a Jay-Z/Linkin Park reference, and I wanted to have a bit of a callback to that.  
这篇文章的每个部分都是一个林肯公园的笑话。标题和第一句是林肯公园多首歌曲的歌词。我这样做是因为我总是试图从一篇文章中获得一点乐趣，而我的 NFT 文章显然是 Jay-Z/Linkin Park 的参考，我想对此有一些回调。

But, jokes aside, seriously, that’s the answer. Forfeit the game, execs. Because, you see, _every single time_ an exec comes in and says “we’re going to do what McNamara did to lose the Vietnam War” because they’re focused on short term growth and not long term sustainability, it _invariably fails_. Sometimes they get off. Other times, they go to jail for 11–25 years.  
但是，抛开笑话不谈，说真的，这就是答案。放弃游戏吧，高管们。因为，你看，每次一位高管进来并说“我们将采取麦克纳马拉所做的事情来输掉越南战争”，因为他们专注于短期增长而不是长期可持续性，它总是会失败。有时他们会下车。其他时候，他们会被判入狱 11 至 25 年。

When Boeing made money, it was run by engineers. It made good product, and customers knew they could trust the brand. Now that Boeing’s run by businessmen, all it ever does is take more human lives than terrorism does. What good does any businessman offer? All they do is mismanage companies chasing after the perverse incentives. They’ve lost the plot.  
当波音公司赚钱时，它是由工程师经营的。它生产出优质的产品，客户知道他们可以信任这个品牌。既然波音公司是由商人经营的，它所做的一切就是比恐怖主义夺走更多的人的生命。商人能提供什么好处？他们所做的只是对追逐不正当激励措施的公司管理不善。他们失去了情节。

The world would be so much better if the people running the companies understood that products people want are what matters. If you’re a businessman and you can’t do that, you’re not even good enough to walk through the front door.  
如果公司的经营者明白人们想要的产品才是最重要的，世界将会变得更加美好。如果你是一个商人而你做不到这一点，那么你甚至连进前门都不够资格。

_Hey, I could use some help with medical bills and groceries. If you want to support the work I do, like_ [_this article_](https://docseuss.medium.com/lore-is-a-trap-and-will-kill-your-story-if-you-let-it-so-what-can-we-do-about-it-9f84850980e3) _about the biggest pitfall young writers face and how to get around it, then hey, hit up my tip jar. Obviously the biggest thing would be to just give me several million dollars to get more games off the ground._  
嘿，我需要一些医疗费和杂货费方面的帮助。如果你想支持我所做的工作，喜欢这篇关于年轻作家面临的最大陷阱以及如何绕过它的文章，那么嘿，打开我的小费罐。显然，最重要的是给我几百万美元来启动更多游戏。

_I figure this kind of writing helps inexperienced writers the most — which means people who might not have the finances to afford my work if I kept it behind a paywall. A paywall would help me, obviously — I could guarantee a certain minimum that would ensure my ability to continue writing these articles — but the people who need my help the most cannot afford it. So I gotta rattle the tip jar. I know it’s not pleasant, but like… think of me like a busker. I’d rather play a song on the street and get a few coins in a hat than just run a gofundme or something._ 
_我认为这种写作对缺乏经验的作家最有帮助——这意味着如果我把作品放在付费墙后面，他们可能没有财力负担我的作品。显然，付费墙会对我有所帮助——我可以保证一定的最低限度，以确保我有能力继续写这些文章——但最需要我帮助的人却负担不起。所以我得把小费罐弄得嘎嘎作响。我知道这并不令人愉快，但就像……把我想象成一个街头艺人。我宁愿在街上播放一首歌，然后在帽子里得到一些硬币，也不愿只是经营一个 gofundme 之类的东西。_

_I, personally, can only do this with your support; if I wasn’t doing this, I’d have to get a second job, and as disabled as I am, that’s really not great. I have to spend between $145 and up to an entire Nintendo Switch’s worth of my income on medical care every two weeks. Seriously, it was $300 not too long ago. That’s an extremely difficult burden for me._ 
_我个人只有在你们的支持下才能做到这一点；如果我不这样做，我就必须找到第二份工作，而像我这样的残疾人，这真的不太好。每两周我必须花费 145 美元到相当于我整个 Nintendo Switch 收入的医疗费用。说实话，不久前还是 300 美元。这对我来说是一个极其困难的负担。_

_So it’s either do this or get a second job, and a second job would not be ideal given my current disability. So when you send me a tip, you’re not just helping a disabled writer like me, you’re helping tons of students, disabled people, and others without access. Thank you._ 
_因此，要么这样做，要么找第二份工作，鉴于我目前的残疾，第二份工作并不理想。因此，当您向我发送提示时，您不仅仅是在帮助像我这样的残疾作家，您还在帮助大量的学生、残疾人和其他无法访问的人。谢谢。_
