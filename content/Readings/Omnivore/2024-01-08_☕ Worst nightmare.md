**Good morning.** The NFL playoff matchups are [set](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fUB?mblid=610ef4d7248c&mbcid=33921704.4035334&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), and if there’s one thing in this world you can be 100% sure of…Americans will be watching along with Bill Belichick. The NFL accounted for 93 of the top 100 US broadcasts last year, according to Sportico, up from 82 in 2022 and 61 five years ago.

The only non-football broadcasts to crack the top 50: the State of the Union address and the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade (which drew a record audience of 28.5 million).

### AVIATION

## [ Alaska Airlines blowout is another problem for Boeing ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fU1?mbcid=33921704.4035334&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) 

[ ![An Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,s_9ESprwqkfOebDV92CEgJ6EZVgJS--rCu_PVJBwxsIQ/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/9e710f78f675cb9de5ebebaba4d2bf49f4fbe550-1024x625.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fU1?mbcid=33921704.4035334&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) _Stephen Brashear/Getty Images_ 

Many people’s worst fears came to life Friday night when an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 jet bound for Ontario, CA, returned to Portland for an emergency landing after a panel blew out around 10 minutes after takeoff. No one was seriously injured, but Boeing is facing fresh scrutiny just as it hoped to put past safety issues behind it.

**It could have been much worse.** The seats near the blowout were [unoccupied](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fUA?mblid=73ed40561c68&mbcid=33921704.4035334&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), and it’s likely all passengers were wearing seat belts, since the aircraft was still climbing at an altitude of \~16,000 feet.

An investigation into what went wrong is ongoing. Supplier Spirit AeroSystems manufactured and installed the aircraft’s fuselage, but Boeing has a [key role](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fU2?mblid=071628314ce6&mbcid=33921704.4035334&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in the completion process, Reuters reported. Aviation authorities said a broader design problem wasn’t suspected “at this time,” and Boeing, which said it supports the investigation, is providing technical help.

**Regulators are keeping the plane on the ground.** The FAA ordered the temporary grounding of the 171 Max 9s in use across US airlines for an inspection that was estimated to last four to eight hours per aircraft.

* On Sunday, Alaska canceled 163 flights (21% of its schedule), United scrubbed 180, and airlines in Mexico, Panama, and Turkey temporarily took most or all of their Max 9s out of service.

## Boeing has more questions to answer

A report by [NBC News](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fU3?mblid=d530f8bd39a4&mbcid=33921704.4035334&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) detailed almost a dozen equipment problems involving Boeing aircraft dating to 2012\. The most damaging were two crashes of its 737 Max 8 less than five months apart—one in Indonesia in 2018 and another in Ethiopia in 2019—that killed a total of 346 passengers, leading to the grounding of all 737 Max 8s globally for 18 months.

Following the mishaps, whistleblowers accused Boeing of fostering a company culture that put profits ahead of safety concerns, and a US House investigation into the fatal crashes bashed Boeing and the FAA for “repeated and serious failures.” Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who has been in the role since January 2020, has tried to restore confidence in the planemaker, but this open-air Alaska flight is sure to put Boeing’s business practices under the spotlight once again.—_DL_

This just in: Scientists have discovered a longevity molecule that restores and renews mitochondria—aka your cellular powerhouses (AP Bio throwback). This is critical because beginning in our 30s, cellular energy declines naturally and is associated with age-related health issues. Mitopure increases cellular energy and supports optimal cell function for improved daily energy now and an active life later.

And yes, it works. In fact, clinical studies found that participants who took daily Mitopure supplements increased muscle strength and endurance _without_ changing their exercise routines.

Lily Gladstone became the first Indigenous person to win best actress in a dramatic film for her role in _Killers of the Flower Moon_, and she began her speech in the language of Blackfeet Nation, her native tribe. _Succession_ was the big winner of the television categories, while the only thing host Jo Koy won was a [death stare](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fUD?mblid=49303d2e467a&mbcid=33921704.4035334&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) from Taylor Swift after his joke about her attending NFL games fell flat.

The space industry has [waited a long time](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fUb?mblid=c30fb85b217e&mbcid=33921704.4035334&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for this morning—a rocket launch sent a US company’s lunar lander on a mission to the moon. If Astrobotic’s Peregrine lander arrives in one piece next month, it’d be the first American spacecraft to touch down on the lunar surface in 50+ years and mark a key milestone in NASA’s efforts to get humans back to playing low-gravity golf.

But one community [wanted to delay](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fUc?mblid=dd814554c97d&mbcid=33921704.4035334&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the launch: Navajo Nation, the US’ largest Native American tribe. That’s because the spacecraft’s payload includes cremated human remains that will be deposited on the moon, which is a sacred place for the Navajo and other Indigenous tribes.

* “The placement of human remains on the moon is a profound desecration of this celestial body revered by our people,” Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren said in a statement.

The White House held a [last-minute meeting](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fUd?mblid=c0828d3b6821&mbcid=33921704.4035334&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) with Navajo Nation to hear out their concerns, but the government emphasized it can’t dictate what cargo a private company carries up to the moon.

The CEO of Celestis, the company that sold the memorial spaceflight, also pushed back, saying, “No individual religion can or should dictate whether a space mission should be approved.”

**Looking ahead…**NASA admitted that its increased reliance on the private sector could lead to more contentious moon missions in the future.—_NF_

**Stat:** In Japan, a record [34.1% of adults](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fUl?mblid=d3db0515dd9c&mbcid=33921704.4035334&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) between the ages of 20 and 49 have never been in a romantic relationship, and more than 25% have no intention of getting married, according to a survey that offers insight into the attitudes of a country where the birthrate declined for a seventh consecutive year in 2022\. Nearly one-fifth of women in their twenties and nearly one-quarter of men in the same age bracket said having a romantic relationship is a waste of time and money. Facing the prospect of widespread labor shortages, the government in June announced plans to provide $25.2 billion in funding for childcare, including financial allowances for childbirth and rearing, as well as increased subsidies for higher education.

Alaska’s snow crab season has been canceled for the second year in a row, and with climate change at the heart of the issue, commercial fishers like Gabriel Prout are [growing concerned](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fUm?mblid=b7cb485c30ef&mbcid=33921704.4035334&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) about the future of their industry. In early 2022, biologists discovered that 90% of the snow crab population had disappeared, which they connected to rising temperatures in the Bering Sea affecting the cold-water crustaceans’ food supply and driving them to starvation. Last year’s cancellation did little to replenish the population, but biologists hope one more year without snow crab fishing will steady Alaska’s fisheries, which provide 60% of the country’s seafood.
