The group created this [AI connoisseur](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fjF?mblid=64b41fe6ddee&mbcid=33710252.4098577&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) by feeding data on the chemical components of 80 wines bottled in France between 1990 and 2007 to a machine-learning model. (The algorithm also correctly guessed the year of origin half of the time.) Other than proving that AI can impress a dinner party, the findings demonstrate how local geography, climate, microbes, and wine-making practices combine to give each wine a unique flavor.

The Nicaraguan government, helmed by authoritarian leader Daniel Ortega, appears to be in meltdown mode over the results of an international beauty pageant.

**How it started:** When Sheynnis Palacios, aka Miss Nicaragua, recently became the first woman from the country to be crowned Miss Universe, the government expressed ‚Äúlegitimate joy and pride.‚Äù

**How it‚Äôs going:** Things turned ugly when the government later claimed that Palacios‚Äôs win was part of an insidious conspiracy against Nicaragua. The government‚Äôs mood likely soured after photos surfaced of Palacios at a mass protest against President Ortega‚Äôs regime in 2018.

And worse, Karen Celebertti, the head of the Miss Nicaragua pageant (which propelled Palacios to her universal triumph), resigned this week after getting charged with treason. Celebertti is currently staying abroad after not being allowed to reenter the country, but her husband and son, who were reportedly involved in the family business, have been detained on accusations of conspiring with her to rig the beauty contest and aid a foreign-sponsored coup.

## Why is Ortega so worked up over a pageant queen?

The 78-year-old former left-wing revolutionary and current president has been tightening his grip on power ever since he assumed office in 2007\. But Ortega‚Äôs fears of dissent went into overdrive after the 2018 protests over social security reforms he initiated. Those rallies were brutally suppressed, leaving over 320 people dead.

There‚Äôs no question that the then-teenaged Palacios was in a crowd of citizens fed up with Ortega‚Äôs rule. Since-deleted protest photos posted on her Facebook profile made the rounds on social media last month after she became Nicaragua‚Äôs first Miss Universe.

Many Nicaraguans living in the country and in exile took her newly gained global beauty queen status as validation of the anti-Ortega resistance cause. In a region where beauty contests are often a public obsession, it‚Äôs customary for pageant fans to celebrate a Miss Universe crowning with fanfare in the streets. But in Nicaragua, the festivities were infused with political defiance.

* Carousing crowds displayed the forbidden blue-and-white national flag that typically serves as a protest of Ortega‚Äôs party banner.
* Some pageant observers believed that Palacios made an allusion to that flag when she donned a white dress with a blue cape at the Miss Universe ceremony held in El Salvador.

Nicaragua‚Äôs First Lady Rosario Murillo called the social media buzz about Palacios‚Äôs victory being an anti-government victory ‚Äúdestructive coup-mongering‚Äù by ‚Äúevil, terrorist commentators.‚Äù

## This is not an isolated incident in Ortega‚Äôs Nicaragua

The government has been rooting out perceived threats for years. Nicaraguan sociologist Elvira Cuadra, who now lives in exile, told the Guardian that her home country has turned into a ‚Äúpolice state.‚Äù There‚Äôs been a harsh crackdown on the Catholic Church in retaliation for some Catholic leaders providing refuge to protesters, and half of the nation‚Äôs universities have been shut down after being branded cradles of dissent.

Dozens of dissidents have been jailed and thousands more have fled the country, while many prominent critics were stripped of their citizenship and sent abroad. Whether Palacios herself will be allowed to return to Nicaragua is unclear, as she‚Äôs been traveling internationally in recent weeks. In her absence, authorities temporarily seized some of her pageant garments and accouterments taken from Karen Celebertti‚Äôs home.

But it isn‚Äôt just Palacios or her pageant circuit colleagues who have dealt with the wrath of the Ortega regime. In a reflection of the country‚Äôs curbs on freedom of expression, a popular TikToker who defended the new Miss Universe has been detained. And two artists who were in the middle of creating a mural dedicated to her were ordered by the police to paint over it.

**It‚Äôs happened before‚Ä¶**Nicaraguan journalist Arturo McFields [points out](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fju?mblid=07e548b33747&mbcid=33710252.4098577&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that this is not the first instance of an authoritarian regime feeling threatened by the popular appeal of a renegade beauty queen: The 2015 Miss Canada, Anastasia Lin, was banned from competing in that year‚Äôs Miss World pageant in China due to her political views. It‚Äôs not even a first for Nicaragua. McFields explained how, in 1979, Nicaraguan Miss Universe contestant Patricia Pineda was forced to return home without competing after her family received death threats from the government._‚ÄîSK_

## [Place to be: The North Pole](#) 

_Elf/Warner Bros._

_It‚Äôs a big world out there. In this section, we‚Äôll teleport you to an interesting location‚Äîand hopefully give you travel ideas in the process._

There‚Äôs only one destination on the minds of savvy tourists right now‚Äîthe North Pole. If you‚Äôre traveling to Santa‚Äôs hometown, learning the cultural norms and practices is essential so you don‚Äôt upset the locals. Here‚Äôs some advice to help you enjoy the winter wonderland.

**If you arrive on Dec. 24,** the bad news is Santa will already be out delivering toys. But the good news is that [NORAD tracks his sleigh](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/eLL?mblid=1c9c28964bcf&mbcid=33710252.4098577&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) as it flies around the globe, which means you can be assured he‚Äôs very far away while you rummage through his house uninvited.

**Hang out behind the workshop.** You know how donut places will throw away excess inventory? The same applies to Santa‚Äôs workshop. Wait to see if the elves dump any garbage bags full of electronics and toys that don‚Äôt have a destination because of last-second naughty list updates.

**If you get there before Santa leaves** for his one day of work per year,bother him for autographs all you want. He‚Äôs not that busy. It doesn‚Äôt take much energy to loom over the factory floor like he‚Äôs Elon Musk II.

**Elves are people.** If you encounter Santa‚Äôs unpaid laborers at a bar unwinding with a hot cocoa after a long day, don‚Äôt be the millionth person to ask about Buddy. Buddy is not real. He is fictional. The elves are real‚Ä¶real sick of that question. You wouldn‚Äôt walk into a boxing gym and ask about Rocky Balboa. Respect the elves.

**Please do not bother Superman.** Yeah, he lives there, too. But it‚Äôs the Fortress of Solitude, not the Fortress of Asking For Selfies. You don‚Äôt want to be bothered when you‚Äôre out of the office during the holidays, and the same applies to Kal-El.‚Äî_DL_

## [Crowd work](#) 

Last week, we asked: What‚Äôs the strangest thing you‚Äôve experienced at a work holiday party?

Here are our favorite responses:

* ‚ÄúAround eight employees at the Bakersfield, CA, office got hammered at the holiday party and spontaneously decided to drive out to Vegas for the weekend. Nothing too crazy happened in Vegas beyond gambling and drinking, but they all arrived back in the office the following Monday having driven straight back from Vegas, still wearing the same (very rumpled) clothes from the holiday party.‚Äù‚Äî_Anonymous_
* ‚ÄúAt a small startup, our offices were in a rented space and we were expanding, which meant that there was going to be a wall torn down between our current office and the space we were expanding into. Our COO/HR/founder got drunk and used everything in sight, including his body and head, to break down the wall in true masculine fashion. I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt work there anymore.‚Äù‚Äî_Jess from Prague, Czech Republic_
* ‚ÄúWe hosted a holiday party and had a psychic who told every other person that the tarot cards said they should quit their jobs.‚Äù‚Äî_Danielle from Blythe, CA_
* ‚ÄúMy wife (my +1) left early, not feeling well. I didn‚Äôt think much of it. She called five minutes later saying she was having the taxi take her to the ER. I left in a panic. My CEO happened to be taking the same elevator down to leave‚Ä¶and he ended up joining me at the emergency room for my wife‚Äôs kidney stone for a few hours. Called for some good next-day stories at the office.‚Äù‚Äî_Scott from Chicago, IL_
