**Good morning.** For decades, Central New Jersey residents have languished in the liminal space between the youse guys of South Jersey and the strip-mall bagel joints of North Jersey.

But now, the state is finally telling its neglected middle child: “You exist.” Last week, NJ Gov. Phil Murphy literally put Central Jersey on the map by ordering the state’s tourism department to redraw its map to include the region and promote it in all marketing campaigns.

Glad you’re finally getting the recognition you deserve, Central Jersey. Round of Sanchezes on me at Hoagie Haven.

* **Markets:** Investors weren’t fazed by Jerome Powell’s warning in Jackson Hole that he could raise interest rates even more, sending the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to their first weekly gain in three weeks. But all this chatter around higher rates has pushed US bond yields to decade-plus highs, which has typically [been a drag](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baL?mblid=23bde5877b4e&mbcid=32527110.4255932&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) on stocks.

Experiencing the world without chemically altering your brain is going out of style.

The use of cannabis and psychedelic drugs among US adults hit [all-time highs](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baN?mblid=5be21fdb2c13&mbcid=32527110.4255932&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) last year, according to the annual Monitoring the Future study from the University of Michigan. The milestone—decades in the making—could be fueled by several factors: loosened laws around these substances, changing public perception of hallucinogens, and more Americans self-medicating for mental health issues.

Here are the cannabis stats you should write down before you forget them.

* 44% of young adults 19–30 and 28% of adults 35–50 reported using marijuana in the prior 12 months, a record high for each age group.
* And more than 11% of young adults said they used cannabis on at least 20 of the prior 30 days, double the share from a decade ago.

**Psychedelic use is also up dramatically.** About 8% of young adults said they used mind-altering drugs like MDMA and psilocybin (shrooms) in the prior 12 months, more than double the rate from 2012.

## Silicon Valley’s drugs of choice

Nowhere is the rise of psychedelics more pronounced than in Silicon Valley, where microdosing has become a [cornerstone of corporate culture](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baO?mblid=9dfd0b9904ad&mbcid=32527110.4255932&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), according to the WSJ. Tech elites have swapped out Don Draper’s old fashioned for ketamine, LSD, and magic mushrooms to alleviate anxiety or help them think of a revolutionary business idea.

* Elon Musk has taken ketamine, Google co-founder Sergey Brin sometimes does shrooms, and the major VC firm Founders Fund has thrown psychedelics-infused parties, per the WSJ.

**But getting high on the job isn’t limited to the tech industry:** The number of American workers testing positive for marijuana hit a [25-year record](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baP?mblid=6c6aa34bea9f&mbcid=32527110.4255932&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) last year, according to an annual survey from Quest Diagnostics.

**Big picture:** More than two-thirds of states allow medical or recreational use of cannabis, and a [flurry of medical studies](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baQ?mblid=2dabef88b772&mbcid=32527110.4255932&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) into psychedelics has shown that, in controlled settings, they can be beneficial for mental illnesses. There’s growing recognition in the scientific community that these drugs have untapped potential to help people, but experts also warn they carry substantial risks that need to be studied more.

The gunman had written manifestos detailing his hatred toward Black people and had drawn swastikas on the two firearms he brought with him into the store. The Jacksonville shooting happened two days before the 60th anniversary (today) of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech at the March on Washington. Thousands of people traveled to the National Mall to mark the pivotal civil rights event.

#SeAcabó, Spanish for “It’s over,” is trending across Spanish social media after a nonconsensual kiss following its women’s World Cup win has [spiraled](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baV?mblid=a197291ef18c&mbcid=32527110.4255932&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) into a broader conversation about women’s equality in the country.

**The latest:** FIFA suspended Spanish soccer federation president Luis Rubiales for 90 days after he grabbed forward Jenni Hermoso’s head and kissed her on the lips during the event’s victory ceremony. Rubiales claims Hermoso gave him consent but Hermoso denied that conversation took place and said she was “the victim of an aggression.”

A defiant Rubiales refused to resign, prompting the World Cup champions to declare they would not play again until he was removed from his position.

Meanwhile, politicians across political lines and the team’s [corporate sponsors](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/baW?mblid=d2b5940b486c&mbcid=32527110.4255932&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) voiced support for Hermoso and condemned Rubiales’s actions.

**Big picture:** Through the #SeAcabó hashtag, women in Spain are using the controversy to spotlight their mistreatment by men that’s never made public. Spain’s acting equality minister called the kiss a “form of sexual violence that we women suffer on a daily basis and until now has been invisible.” And Spanish player Misa Rodríguez shared a cartoon that depicts a girl asking her grandmother, “Grandma, tell me about how your team won the World Cup.” The grandmother replies, “We didn’t just win the World Cup, little one. We won so much more.”

**A high-stakes US trip to China:** CommerceSecretary Gina Raimondo flew to China over the weekend for a four-day trip. While there, she’ll try to strike the [tricky balance](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ba%5F?mblid=4111cb5f30b3&mbcid=32527110.4255932&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) between promoting US–China business ties and defending widespread trade restrictions her department has slapped on China in the name of national security. Fun fact: Raimondo started the first venture capital fund in Rhode Island before becoming the state’s governor.

**Jobs, inflation in focus:** Jerome Powell will be poring over fresh inflation data (Thursday) and the August jobs report (Friday) to guide his next interest rate move.

**Stat:** France is about to spend about $216 million destroying [nearly 80 million gallons](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bb1?mblid=371e81d96a83&mbcid=32527110.4255932&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of surplus wine, enough liquid to fill more than 100 Olympic-sized swimming pools, the Washington Post reported. The problem is that higher production costs and shrinking demand for vin have made it impossible for French wineries to sell their spiked grape juice for a profit, even if it does have tantalizing hints of oak and leather. The average French citizen drinks about 40 liters of wine per year, compared to 136 liters in 1926.
