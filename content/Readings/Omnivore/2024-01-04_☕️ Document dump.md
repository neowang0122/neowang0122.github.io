**Good morning.** On the East Coast, snow has become as rare as a respectable breakfast burrito, but that could change this weekend when a major storm is forecast to hit the region.

Of course, there’s also a chance it could simply rain in the major cities, prolonging our pow-less misery: New York (689 days), Philadelphia (704), and Baltimore (705) are currently in their longest droughts on record since one inch of snow fell in a 24-hour period.

You’ve had it rough, too, Californians. After turning it into a winter wonderland last year, the state’s snowpack was just at 25% of typical levels at the turn of 2024—the lowest in a decade.

## [ Names linked to Jeffery Epstein unsealed ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fMI?mbcid=33883966.3523733&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)

A New York federal court [released](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fMJ?mblid=680c9b8cedef&mbcid=33883966.3523733&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) nearly 1,000 pages of newly unsealed documents yesterday from a civil lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of participating in the sex crimes of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.

The [documents](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fMK?mblid=0b4e45484362&mbcid=33883966.3523733&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) came into public view because of a judge’s order to reveal the true identities of almost 200 John and Jane Does associated with the lawsuit, which was brought by outspoken Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell and was settled in 2017 before Maxwell’s 2021 criminal conviction. The name drop was inaccurately hyped before it happened as the reveal of Epstein’s “client list,” but being named in the documents does not necessarily imply wrongdoing, as they mention alleged Epstein victims, contacts, employees, and others.

* Two of the biggest names included in the documents, former Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, were already known to have met Epstein, and the records [do not indicate](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fML?mblid=0f05a4fa63d8&mbcid=33883966.3523733&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that either one had engaged in illegal activity.
* The documents also featured names of people who previously denied wrongdoing, including Prince Andrew (who settled a separate lawsuit with Giuffre), attorney Alan Dershowitz, and hedge fund billionaire Glenn Dubin.

**Why now?** Epstein died by suicide in a jail cell in 2019, but interest in his crimes and his ties to influential people remains—though only Epstein and Maxwell have been criminally charged in connection with his sex trafficking. After the Miami Herald pushed for public access to the documents from Giuffre’s lawsuit, including depositions of Maxwell and alleged victims, US District Judge Loretta Preska [ordered](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fMM?mblid=6380aae90678&mbcid=33883966.3523733&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) their release, noting that much of the information in them had already been made public in other court cases and media coverage.

**Looking ahead…**more documents are expected to be released, which could continue to spur speculation about associations with Epstein. In advance of yesterday’s document dump, quarterback Aaron Rodgers baselessly implied comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s name might be in them, prompting the late-night host to [threaten to sue](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fNm?mblid=44bd454b4066&mbcid=33883966.3523733&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)._—CC, AR_

Iranian officials described the blasts as terrorist attacks, but no group immediately claimed responsibility for them. The bombings came as tensions were already running high in the region because of the Israel–Hamas war.

Trump’s appeal seeks an answer to the high-stakes question of whether the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding office applies to him. Trump is currently the GOP front-runner in the presidential election, and the issue extends beyond Colorado—Maine’s secretary of state determined he should not be allowed on the ballot there, and the Oregon Supreme Court is also weighing the issue. Trump is asking the justices to reverse the Colorado ruling without hearing oral arguments.

Hiring was also down. It’s the latest sign that the Fed’s rate hikes have finally started to cool the once-scorching labor market to help curb inflation, but not so much that it’s looking like a recession. And, while it held bad news for job seekers, the Labor Department’s data also showed that quitting and layoffs have slowed.

Elon Musk might wingman your next “U up?” text if you’re a T-Mobile customer: Yesterday, the billionaire’s aerospace company, SpaceX, [launched](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fMU?mblid=437e299e9999&mbcid=33883966.3523733&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) six Starlink satellites designed to provide LTE mobile phones with network signals, even out in the boonies.

The Direct to Cell satellites, which SpaceX describes as “a cell phone tower in space,” are meant to plug connectivity holes in remote areas where it’s currently impossible to get a single bar. After a period of testing…

* SpaceX will provide satellite coverage in partnership with T-Mobile in the US and through six other carriers around the world.
* Direct to Cell will only enable texting at first, but voice and data will follow “in the coming years,” T-Mobile said.

Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite business, is expected to pull in $10 billion in sales this year, surpassing SpaceX’s rocket launch business and accounting for most of the company’s total revenue, according to Bloomberg.

After spending eight years behind bars for her role in her mother’s murder, Blanchard is rushing to capitalize on her own lore.

For those who aren’t [Patricia Arquette super fans](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fM%5F?mblid=5b370019948f&mbcid=33883966.3523733&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)—Blanchard pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2016 for the killing of her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard. Blanchard testified that in June 2015, her then-boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, stabbed her mother with her knowledge while she was in the next room. Godejohn is currently serving a life sentence. As portrayed in both documentaries and a fictionalized series, Blanchard claimed her mother had Munchausen syndrome by proxy and subjected her to years of unnecessary medical treatment for illnesses she didn’t have, like leukemia and muscular dystrophy. 

**What’s she up to now?** One of the first things Blanchard did after getting out of prison (like anyone who has a nonconsensual Hulu show based on their life) was get an iPhone 15 and start recording. Her Instagram has over 6 million followers, and #gypsyrose has 3.4 billion views on TikTok. And she’s embracing the spotlight: She’s used the accounts to promote an upcoming Lifetime docuseries and an e-book about her experience._—MM_

But you’re still not likely to run into one you can pet on the street: There are only about 400 of them in the US.

**Quote:** “I can’t feel my fingers.”

Thirteen-year-old Willis Gibson, better known on YouTube as Blue Scuti, may have lost the feeling in his digits, but he did it achieving a rare accomplishment: He’s believed to be the first person ever to have [beaten _Tetris_](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fN4?mblid=f266da97e72c&mbcid=33883966.3523733&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). In a video the competitive _Tetris_ player posted, he stacked shapes until he reached Level 157, which caused the game to freeze because he had reached the highest level allowed by its coding. For years, Level 29 was thought to be the upper limit where blocks start falling so rapidly it’s impossible to keep up, but even before Gibson’s big victory, gamers’ lightning-quick thumbs had already proved that wrong.
