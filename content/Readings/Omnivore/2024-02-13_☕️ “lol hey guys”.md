**Good morning.** Today is Mardi Gras, the climax of Carnival season, and if you want to sound in the know, you can use the official Mardi Gras greeting in Cajun French, _laissez les bons temps rouler_. We do not know how to pronounce that, but we can tell you what it means in English: “Let the good times roll.”

And the times they are indeed rolling—Lent starts tomorrow, then Easter arrives in just over six weeks. Apparently no one told Winter Storm Lorraine, which is smacking the Northeast this morning.

For a genre of music that has rarely gone mainstream, country is now coming to dominate the industry…with help from Beyoncé.

During the Super Bowl on Sunday, Beyoncé dropped two new songs, “Texas Hold ‘Em” and “16 Carriages,” and announced a [country album](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hck?mblid=83c37c255749&mbcid=34325865.3486077&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) scheduled for release on March 29\. Members of the Beyhive weren’t surprised: She’s been hinting at it for years, wore a giant cowboy hat to the Grammys, and is, after all, from Houston.

Still, her announcement has sparked a new conversation around who gets to make country music. The country song on her album _Lemonade_, “Daddy Lessons,” was [deemed ineligible](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hcl?mblid=6d3ba1fdc5f3&mbcid=34325865.3486077&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for country music categories at the 2017 Grammys by the Recording Academy’s country music committee, and her performance of the song at the Country Music Association Awards with the Chicks got criticism from some country fans. Other Black artists, such as Lil Nas X, haven’t always been welcomed by the genre. But as country gains mainstream popularity, many see potential for a new era as the genre grows.

## Everyone’s grabbing a banjo

Take it from indie-popstar Lana Del Rey: “The music business is going country.” That’s what the artist, who is releasing a country album in September titled _Lasso_, told Billboard this month. She’s not wrong: Rapper Post Malone, who debuted on the country charts last year, has also confirmed that he has a country album [in the works](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hcm?mblid=da5ff23624c6&mbcid=34325865.3486077&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

**What changed?** Maybe music execs finally listened to Eric Church’s “Springsteen” and realized what every person in a state with a Bojangles knows: Country music is good music. But more likely, the change is thanks to…Morgan Wallen.

* Country music streaming grew 24% YoY through Q3 2023\. Wallen was responsible for almost a third of the growth, according to entertainment data company Luminate.
* Last June, No. 1 and No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart were country songs: “Last Night” by Morgan Wallen and the “Fast Car” cover by Luke Combs.

**Big picture:** Gen Z and millennials are also driving the surge in country. In 2023, 36% of streams of Spotify’s Top 50 songs were country songs, compared to 2% in 2016._—CC_

The raid to free them from an apartment in the southern Gaza city of Rafah included airstrikes that killed 94 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which is Hamas-run. This came as Israel is preparing for a ground offenisve in Rafah, which it considers a Hamas stronghold, where the UN estimates 1.3 million Palestinians are currently living, many because they fled from the north to escape the war. Meanwhile, a Dutch court [ordered](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hcs?mblid=69103d1e7d5c&mbcid=34325865.3486077&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the government to stop sending fighter jet parts to Israel because of concerns they could be used to violate international law.

Yo youngsters, word on the street is President Biden is lowkey goated. Or at least he’s joined TikTok and posted his first video this weekend: A tongue-in-cheek [Super Bowl Q&A](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hcv?mblid=1cbf4301c0e4&mbcid=34325865.3486077&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) captioned “lol hey guys” garnered more than 6 million views as of last night.

The president’s reelection campaign runs the new BidenHQ account—complete with “Grows the economy” in the bio and a profile pic referencing the [Dark Brandon meme](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hcw?mblid=6987220e2b5c&mbcid=34325865.3486077&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). His debut on the platform is widely seen as a way for him to woo Gen Z voters amid concerns about his age.

* While young Americans helped Biden win his first term, he alienated some of them with his stance on the Israel–Hamas war and his climate policy. Some polls have shown him trailing the likely GOP candidate, Donald Trump, among voters in their 20s.
* Embracing TikTok could help him reach younger voters: Almost a third of American adults under age 30 regularly get news on the app, per Pew Research Center.

Biden, of course, didn’t invent TikTok politicking. Indonesian presidential candidates have [danced and livestreamed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hcx?mblid=d59c71b3d1e2&mbcid=34325865.3486077&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in the run-up to the country’s election, which is taking place tomorrow.

A new app for singles isn’t focused on finding Pams for all of the Jims who know the best spot in town for margaritas—it just wants to connect singles who pay their bills on time.

Applications are now open to [join Score](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hcC?mblid=9c429bfd6e9b&mbcid=34325865.3486077&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), a limited-time dating app for people with credit scores of 675 or above, developed by the financial wellness platform Neon Money Club.

“Before you can educate people, you need to get their attention,” Neon Money Club CEO Luke Bailey told [TechCrunch](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hcD?mblid=e8d32f08ee03&mbcid=34325865.3486077&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). Score isn’t a Tinder replacement—it’s a social experiment aimed at making people 1) feel more comfortable discussing money in their relationships and 2) better understand personal finance. That’s why applicants who don’t make the cut receive resources on how to improve their credit scores.

**The dating app will only run for \~90 days.** But Score isn’t purely a stunt.People really _are_ more likely to start serious relationships if they have high credit scores, according to [research](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hcE?mblid=a17a3ec4bcb5&mbcid=34325865.3486077&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) by the Federal Reserve.

**Financial literacy is hot…**especially among Gen Zers, who care more about financial compatibility than any other generation, according to a Northwestern Mutual [survey](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hcF?mblid=9b61c2c073ad&mbcid=34325865.3486077&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

**Stat:** Planning to buy that special someone chocolate for Valentine’s Day? We hope you’ve been saving up because the quintessential “I bought this at the drugstore on the way to our date” gift is extra pricey this year thanks to a spike in the [cost of cocoa](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hcK?mblid=f61bdde7ca9e&mbcid=34325865.3486077&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). Last week, a metric ton of cocoa was trading at a record $5,600, per Bloomberg—surpassing the previous high price set in 1977\. It’s due to a poor harvest caused by climate conditions in West Africa, where 60% of cocoa is grown. A food and beverage economist told CNN that retail chocolate prices have climbed 17% over the past two years. Still, the National Confectioners Association says \~92% of Americans plan to buy chocolate or candy for the holiday.

**Quote:** “I’m so sorry if the Super Bowl advertisement caused anyone in my family pain.”

For some, the ads are the most exciting part of the Super Bowl, but one group unhappy with this year’s marketing efforts was the cousins of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Several of them criticized a Super PAC spot supporting him that repurposed an ad from his uncle John F. Kennedy’s successful 1960 presidential campaign, prompting RFK Jr. to [apologize](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/hcL?mblid=d92424b10721&mbcid=34325865.3486077&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) and explain he’d had no hand in making the ad—while leaving it pinned to the top of his X feed. It’s not the first time RFK Jr.’s campaign has caused family drama to spill out into the open: In October, four of his siblings said, “Bobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision, or judgment.”
