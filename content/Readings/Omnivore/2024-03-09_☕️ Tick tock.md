## [ The clock may be going ticktock on TikTok ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iak?mbcid=34623484.81959&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)

The only thing more perturbing than TikToker Reesa Teesa’s video series account of her ex-husband’s torrid double life is the fact that you may soon have to go to YouTube to watch it.

A congressional committee voted unanimously on Thursday to advance a bill to the House that would be tantamount to a ban on TikTok, jeopardizing the future of the app used by 170 million Americans.

* US lawmakers have long expressed concerns about TikTok’s influence and accused the app’s parent company, ByteDance, of being linked to the Chinese Communist Party (which both TikTok and ByteDance deny).
* But the committee became extra motivated to fast-track the bill after TikTok encouraged users to call their representatives and ask them not to ban the app. This resulted in a flood of calls and what may be the greatest social media [backfire](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ial?mblid=ade27eef6e8b&mbcid=34623484.81959&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) since Elmo asked, “How is everybody doing?”

**What the bill says:** The [bipartisan bill](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iam?mblid=db5ffdf8be50&mbcid=34623484.81959&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) aims to “protect the national security of the United States from the threat posed by foreign adversary controlled applications.” Practically, the bill gives ByteDance two choices: Find a US company to buy TikTok within six months or shut it down.

## Video app-turned-political pawn

Yesterday, President Biden said he would sign the bill if it got through Congress—even though the president’s reelection campaign [joined the platform](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ian?mblid=93f81d1871c5&mbcid=34623484.81959&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) last month. 

The legislation has to get passed first, though, and previous efforts to address TikTok have stalled. A bill that would have allowed the Commerce Department to ban tech from outside the US died in the Senate last year. Still, experts are cautiously optimistic about the new bill since it’s more targeted at TikTok.

**But TikTok still has supporters.** The ACLU called the bill an effort to score “cheap political points during an election year.” Former President Trump posted on Truth Social, “If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business,” in an apparent 180 after signing an executive order in 2020 that intended to ban TikTok._—CC_

Steel giant POSCO is too. The Department of Energy even awarded EnergyX $5m to extract American lithium.

Teague and EnergyX aren’t slowing down, either. They acquired 90k acres of lithium reserves—enough for EnergyX to produce 40k metric tons of lithium a year.

Rather, suspected UFOs from 1945 to now have turned out to be “ordinary objects and phenomena and the result of misidentification,” including test flights of government spy planes in the ’50s and ’60s.

This additional approval may help broaden insurance coverage for the drug, which is costly and not always covered. But it might still be hard for patients to get, as it’s in short supply. Novo Nordisk is also seeking a similar approval in Europe.

Electric-car maker Rivian made tech lords smile with teeth when it unveiled its new mid-price car and then surprise-revealed two _more_ handsome new models this week.

Within 24 hours, Rivian said it [received](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iaa?mblid=7fb7b463f4f7&mbcid=34623484.81959&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) 68,000+ reservations for its $45,000 R2 SUV, a competitor to Tesla’s Model Y. The unexpected releases—a compact SUV called the R3 and its high-performance version, the R3X—aren’t available for preorder yet, but their sleek designs and intriguing [additional features](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iab?mblid=299ee2b9a7f9&mbcid=34623484.81959&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) are generating shut-up-and-take-my-money buzz.

Rivian’s stock soared 17.25% this week in response, but time is [not on its side](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iac?mblid=7c53ae6e0ee6&mbcid=34623484.81959&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a): By the time R2 deliveries begin in 2026, more electric SUVs will be on the market (including one from Volkswagen Group).

Then there’s the burning cash of it all. Rivian, which is backed by Amazon:

* Is losing $43,000 on each first-generation car it builds, per a recent earnings report.
* Could need $2.5 billion more to survive until R2 production gets going, a Jefferies analyst estimates.
* Lost $5.4 billion last year and doesn’t think it will sell many more cars in 2024 than it did in 2023, scaring some investors.

**Cost-cutting collateral:** To save \~$2.3 billion, Rivian announced yesterday it’s [postponing the construction](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iad?mblid=bf55fbd4d070&mbcid=34623484.81959&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of an R2 factory outside Atlanta that would’ve created thousands of jobs._—ML_

**Why?** The leaders of neighboring countries were miffed about the exclusive deal Singapore cut with the singer to be the only Southeast Asian country she visited. This kind of agreement, known as a “radius clause,” is common in the music industry but rarely extends outside of a country.

* Thailand’s prime minister accused Singapore of paying as much as $3 million per show to keep “Sparks Fly” within its borders.
* Singapore said the actual price it paid was much lower, but refused to reveal the number.

**Even at the highest estimates, it** **was a good investment:** Swifties who flocked to Singapore are expected to have spent up to $300 million on food, lodging, and other tourism-related purchases while visiting, likely juicing the country’s GDP by [.02 percentage points](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iaw?mblid=d59d49908521&mbcid=34623484.81959&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) this quarter, according to Bloomberg.

The most recent one was yesterday when a United Airlines plane rolled off the runway into the grass after landing in Houston, forcing the evacuation of its 160 passengers and six crew members (no one was hurt). Before that, another United plane lost a tire after takeoff while a third had flames coming from its engine—luckily, no one was injured in those situations, either.

**Quote:** “I suspect this pizza topping ‘fact’ may have been inserted as a joke or to test if I was paying attention, since it does not fit with the other topics at all.”

That’s not quite, “I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that,” but Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus chatbot made waves this week when an engineer revealed that the AI model [appeared to know](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iaB?mblid=2ba46e0cc757&mbcid=34623484.81959&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) it was being tested. The engineer [posted on X](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iaC?mblid=9890232de4fd&mbcid=34623484.81959&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that during a “needle-in-the-haystack” evaluation where a sentence about pizza toppings was inserted into documents about other topics, Opus was asked to find it. Not only did the AI locate the right sentence, but it also flagged that it was unrelated to the rest of the text…and correctly surmised why.

## Open House

Welcome to Open House, the only newsletter section that sees the _vision_. We’ll give you a few facts about a listing and you try to guess the price.

![Renderings of Miami Penthouse.](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,svpAog6DFquIwLhsYngQX1jAmjwHWgrLpa8UguKyxslE/https://storage.morningbrew.com/gif/2024-03-08/image-25eb9c268358b5316c563503c54e425b2a0bae5d-1920x960-gif/miamipenthouse.gif)_Renderings by The Boundary_

Today’s [penthouse](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/iaP?mblid=f924808e7bfd&mbcid=34623484.81959&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) isn’t finished yet, but most real estate promises totally pan out. The listing is in the iconic, soon-to-be redeveloped Shore Club, an Art Deco hotel in Miami originally built in the 1930s. Amenities include:

* 10,500 square feet inside
* 7,500 square feet of terraces
* Private rooftop pool

The penthouse is in a pending sale that would shatter Ken Griffin’s current record residential sale in the city. How much is it on the verge of being bought for?
