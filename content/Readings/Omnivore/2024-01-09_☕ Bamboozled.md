**Good morning.** Coming to an Apple commercial near you: An iPhone that apparently got sucked out of the Alaska Airlines plane when the door panel blew out was found on the side of the road…still intact _and_ working even after plummeting 16,000 feet to the ground.

Talk about a best-case scenario.

Tiger Woods announced yesterday on X that he’s [ending](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fX6?mblid=9b7e96ff50d9&mbcid=33933042.3948256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) his historic 27-year partnership with Nike. The news marks the end of one of golf’s most iconic images: Woods in a red Nike polo on the Sunday of a PGA Tour event.

**A deal for the ages:** Nike signed Woods in 1996, the year he turned pro as a 20-year-old, in a $40 million contract that at the time was the largest golf endorsement deal. The signature Nike swoosh stayed with him throughout his illustrious career: Woods earned $500 million over the nearly three decades of the relationship, per estimates.

**But all good things come to an end…**the sports world had [speculated](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fX7?mblid=7cb46fabf388&mbcid=33933042.3948256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that Woods would hang up his Nike hat for good when the deal expired at the end of 2023\. Since Nike shut down its golf equipment division in 2016, Woods has been using other brands’ clubs and balls and was most recently spotted on the course not in Nikes but in [FootJoy shoes](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fX8?mblid=290032e12ef5&mbcid=33933042.3948256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), which he’s said offer more stability as he recovers from an injury sustained during a car accident in 2021.

## What’s next for the Big Cat?

Woods will likely play at the Genesis Invitational next month, his first official PGA Tour event in almost a year as he recovers from injury. But as far as brand deals go…no one knows for sure. Sports reporters think he’ll either start a brand within the golf company TaylorMade or create an entirely new brand.

Some in the golf world thought Woods might take a page from tennis star Roger Federer’s book and sign a deal with On Running, the Swiss shoe brand. Federer [separated](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fX9?mblid=46596e883243&mbcid=33933042.3948256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) from Nike in 2018 to join Uniqlo and invested in On Running—which gave him a $300 million payday when the company went public three years later. But the company’s chief executive shut down those rumors yesterday.

**Not the only departure from Nike…**[Jason Day](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fXa?mblid=3a3fc80a8650&mbcid=33933042.3948256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) left Nike just last week for the Malbon brand. While Nike has plenty of other big-name golfers donning the swoosh logo, its long-term future in the sport is uncertain._—CC_

Meanwhile, federal officials revealed that the plane involved in the incident was restricted from flying long flights over water due to a known pressurization problem, though that may have been unrelated to the door plug incident.

After a successful launch on Monday, Astrobotic posted on X that an anomaly led to a “critical loss of propellant,” forcing the company to change its mission objective. Peregrine was supposed to be the first American spacecraft to land on the lunar surface in more than 50 years. The mishap raises questions ahead of NASA’s crewed Artemis mission in November about the space agency’s approach to funding startups to send experiments to the moon rather than launch its own spacecraft.

The world’s smallest Stradivarius is playing for Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, who says Sotheby’s bamboozled him into overpaying $1+ billion for art treasures.

The Monaco-based fertilizer mogul is taking the storied auctioneers to a Manhattan court this week for allegedly [conspiring to defraud him](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fXf?mblid=b9b94535d521&mbcid=33933042.3948256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). Rybolovlev claims Sotheby’s abetted his longtime art advisor, Yves Bouvier, in deceitfully inflating the prices of a Modigliani sculpture, as well as paintings by Leonardo da Vinci, René Magritte, and Gustav Klimt.

The trial will give humble museum-goers a rare glimpse under the hood of the notoriously shady and unregulated private art market.

## The fine strokes

Rybolovlev spent $2 billion snatching up Louvre-quality masterpieces between 2002 and 2014 via purchases arranged by Bouvier, with 12 of them brokered by Sotheby’s. But then Rybolovlev allegedly learned that…

* The 38 artworks he bought actually belonged to Bouvier, who pretended to negotiate the prices with nonexistent sellers.
* In some instances, the oligarch might have been overcharged: He paid $127.5 million for a 500-year-old da Vinci a day after Bouvier obtained it for $83 million (perhaps this [wasn’t such a rotten deal](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fXg?mblid=c99b1a74f555&mbcid=33933042.3948256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), since Rybolovlev later sold it for $450.3 million).

A fierce legal battle ensued between the two art connoisseurs, spanning multiple jurisdictions in Europe and Asia. They recently settled their differences out of court, and Bouvier stressed that investigators found no criminal wrongdoing.

**Sotheby’s is taking off its white gloves…**one of its lawyers said there’s “zero evidence” that the auction house knew Bouvier was lying to Rybolovlev._—SK_

* According to Zillow, the average cost of a home in Buffalo is \~$248k, well below the national average of \~$347k. The typical Buffalonian pays about $1.8k monthly for their mortgage, or $1.3k in rent.
* Buffalo also has the highest rate of new jobs per new home out of the 50 biggest cities in the US, according to Zillow, which uses this metric to determine expected housing demand.

**Get ready for Silicon Billy.** In October, the Biden administration named Buffalo a “tech hub” for semiconductor manufacturing, which means the city could get billions of dollars in government funding via the [CHIPS Act](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9-Z?mblid=44c3db705dc3&mbcid=33933042.3948256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

**Stat:** A lot of the people who felt the urge to adopt a dog during the pandemic are now saying er, actually, nevermind—and it’s throwing shelters [into crisis](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fWT?mblid=d5de27451ae1&mbcid=33933042.3948256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). Bloomberg reported that the number of stray dogs in US shelters has increased by 22% since 2021, per data from the Shelter Animals Count database. And it’s not just older dogs losing their homes—shelter workers say they’re seeing more puppies, too. Worst of all, canine deaths in shelters are up 27% from last year and 78% from 2021 as they deal with overcrowding. Experts attribute the crisis to return-to-office mandates, the rising costs of petcare, and the end of pandemic-era eviction restrictions that are allowing landlords to enforce pet policies.

**Quote:** “Thank you Bob.”

It’s not every day that you come across a chunk of a Boeing 737 Max 9 in your backyard, but then again, not everyone is Bob. The teacher from Portland, Oregon, alerted the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on Sunday that he [found the door plug](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fWU?mblid=9fcf5646b3c3&mbcid=33933042.3948256&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that fell off Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 last week, which should help the agency investigate how exactly a piece of a plane can just blow away midflight. The NTSB was quick to thank Bob in its press conference announcing the discovery of the door plug.
