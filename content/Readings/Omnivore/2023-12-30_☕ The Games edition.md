**Good morning.** Since we close out every Brew with trivia and games, we thought it would be fitting to say goodbye to 2023 with an entire newsletter dedicated to them. In this edition, you’ll be tasked with guessing a company from its stock chart, naming the sports champions of 2023, and many more tests of knowledge you’d probably encounter at Ken Jennings’s Christmas party.

* **Warning:** The answers are located in the same section as the questions, so don’t scroll down until you’ve made your guesses!

Finally, a huge thanks to Mary Tobler, who helped put together this newsletter and created all of the Brew’s games throughout the year. She’s the best in the biz.

Have a Happy New Year! We’ll see you next on Tuesday with regularly scheduled programming.

—_Neal Freyman, Mary Tobler_

3\. “I probably trust the answers that come out of ChatGPT the least of anybody on Earth.”

4\. “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me.”

5\. “I’ve actually calculated that I’ve spent more time on the ship than the captain did back in the day.”

6\. “Why would I want to stay here? To hell with this place.”

7\. “I understood him to be directing me to come up with ways to conceal things in our balance sheet we both agreed would look bad.”

8\. “I wish you well.”

9\. “To be honest, when I found out the patriarchy wasn’t just about horses, I lost interest.”

10\. “Go f—— yourself.”
