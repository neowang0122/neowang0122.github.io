Hello everyone! üê± I presented to you the v1 of Ugly Duckling almost a year ago (how time flies!), but sadly, it was killed by changes in X/Twitter shortly after its first launch here. Although initially I wanted to completely abandon this project, I realized that there was a lack of affordable options in this saturated market, so I decided to look for a way to resurrect the Duckling. I've completely rewritten the app in January, and since then, over 200 people have joined this new, little duck pond üê§ What has changed? - Ugly Duckling has a new home! It's now a Web Application - It uses X API instead of scraping (no longer maintained) X Analytics - Achievements for effort, growth, and consistency - Community leaderboards - Weekly progress reports - Consistency chart - Improved sharing (public URLs, new options for images export) - A completely new Browser Extension I'm so excited to show you the Ugly Duckling v2 and I can't wait to hear your feedback and suggestions!

[@norbertjurga](https://www.producthunt.com/@norbertjurga) love the story, Norbert. The app looks cool and solves a big problem in budget. Congrats and keep the good work flowing!
