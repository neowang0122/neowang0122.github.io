**Good morning.** Is it OK to eat snow? That’s the question dividing the internet after Reese Witherspoon went viral for her “Snow Salt Chococcino” recipe (ingredients: cold brew, salted caramel, chocolate sauce, and…snow from her backyard).

Faced with pushback, Witherspoon argued her concoction was safe. Scientists generally agree that it’s fine to eat snow, provided you help yourself to small quantities and the snow is fresh from recent accumulation.

Chicago claims to have the best snow in the country, but we prefer New Haven-style.

Wanna know what it’s like to get knocked out by an RKO? Every streaming service that isn’t Netflix might know the feeling.

Yesterday, Netflix announced a $5 billion deal with WWE, cementing its position as the winner of the streaming wars. The 10-year agreement will bring WWE’s flagship show, _Monday Night Raw_, to the platform in the US, UK, Canada, and Latin America in 2025.

This means that _Raw_, which may or may not continue on Monday nights on Netflix, will not air on linear TV for the first time in its 31-year history.

* Netflix will also stream all WWE shows, like _SmackDown_ and _NXT_, outside the US.
* Annual live events, including WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Royal Rumble—in addition to documentaries and other WWE projects—will all be on Netflix.

## What’s next for the ’flix?

The deal marks Netflix’s largest foray yet into live sports, after years of its executives saying the company wasn’t interested in sports rights. (They said their platform wouldn’t have ads either—look how that turned out.)

If a landmark wrestling deal wasn’t enough for one day, Netflix also posted its Q4 earnings, headlined by 13.1 million new subscribers—its largest Q4 increase ever, blowing past estimates of 8–9 million. Its stock jumped more than 8% in after-hours trading.

In a letter to its shareholders, Netflix basically said “good luck” to other streamers that consider teaming up to take down the king…

* The company said it has no interest in “acquiring linear assets” and that further media consolidation won’t “materially change the competitive environment.”
* Netflix maintained that it’s bullish on investing in new content at a time when other streaming platforms are cutting back. (Though Netflix _has_ done some [trimming](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gtZ?mblid=534f7536093e&mbcid=34101066.3978341&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of its own.)

**We’ll do it live:** Netflix is hosting the 30th annual SAG Awards show in February, and the Netflix Slam, a tennis match between Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz, in March. Hopefully those go better than the _Love Is Blind_ reunion.—_CC_

Nikki Haley, the only serious challenger remaining in the field. Haley will likely now face pressure to drop out, as New Hampshire was widely considered her best and last chance to beat Trump. Next up on the Republican primary schedule is Haley’s home state, where she’s down by 30 points, according to many polls. On the Democratic side, President Joe Biden easily beat Rep. Dean Phillips despite not even appearing on the ballot (he received write-in votes instead). Biden boycotted the primary after New Hampshire refused to comply with the Democratic National Committee’s decision to make South Carolina the first state to vote.

Right behind was _Poor Things_ and _Killers of the Flower Moon_ with 11 and 10 nominations, respectively. Oppie’s dominance marked a pivot for Academy voters, who in recent years have generally favored smaller movies over studio blockbusters. _Barbie_, meanwhile, garnered eight noms, including one for best picture—but director Greta Gerwig and star Margot Robbie were snubbed.

The company, which owns Vogue, GQ, and Vanity Fair, also announced that it’s folding the music website Pitchfork into GQ, and laying off a number of its staff. A-list star Anne Hathaway reportedly walked out of a Vanity Fair photo shoot in solidarity with union members after she was informed of the work stoppage. The walkout comes amid a particularly dreadful period for online and print media, as the Los Angeles Times, Vox Media, Vice Media, and several other companies have conducted layoffs in recent months.

You’re over making dinner plans with your chronically flaky friend, and United feels the same way about Boeing. The airline will [no longer count](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gtL?mblid=a6341ac85ad2&mbcid=34101066.3978341&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) on Boeing delivering the delayed Max 10 next-gen planes it ordered, United’s frustrated CEO Scott Kirby said on CNBC’s _Squawk Box_ show yesterday.

The smh statement from one of Boeing’s biggest customers comes after a terrifying safety incident on an Alaska Airlines flight this month led to the indefinite grounding of all 737 Max 9 jets. United has more Max 9s than any other airline, and having to send all 79 of them to the hangar has led the company to “at least build a plan” for its fleet without the Max 10.

* Kirby said the Max 9 grounding became “the straw that broke the camel’s back for us” and that he wants Boeing to deal with its manufacturing woes faster.
* United projects a bigger-than-predicted loss in the first quarter of 2024 and higher costs due to the plane issues.

Boeing’s latest stumble follows years of quality issues and production delays, while its overseas rival Airbus thrives. The European consortium [surpassed Boeing](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gtM?mblid=6a756ec425d3&mbcid=34101066.3978341&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) as the biggest planemaker in the world in 2019: It won 2,100 net orders last year, compared to Boeing’s 1,300.

The only thing better than success is success years after everyone made you a meme. The video game _Palworld_, which has been mockingly referred to as “_Pokémon_ with guns” since its announcement in 2021, [sold](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gtR?mblid=19811b9014cf&mbcid=34101066.3978341&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) over 6 million copies in its first four days and has broken at least one record on the platform Steam.

Developed by Japanese company Pocket Pair, the open-world survival game allows players to build settlements, farm, and spend hours smashing rocks. You also fight and trap little monsters that closely resemble Pokémon. But in _Palworld_, you can violently fire machine guns at them.

**It’s a hit.** Whether because recent (actual) _Pokémon_ games have kinda flopped, or because gamers just appreciate that Pocket Pair created a hodgepodge of their favorite games, _Palworld_ has taken the internet by storm. As of last night, it was the top-selling game—and the most played game—on Steam, with over 1.8 million concurrent users.

**Are Pikachu lookalikes legal?** Some observers have pointed out that some of the creatures in _Palworld_ are _so_ similar to Pokémon that their 3D models [fit perfectly together](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gtS?mblid=24197a554a6e&mbcid=34101066.3978341&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). Pocket Pair’s CEO has vehemently denied copying anything, while _Pokémon_\-owner Nintendo has declined to comment so far. Legal experts say the games and creatures are just different enough for _Palworld_ to get away with it._—MM_

**Stat:** If your company’s director is old enough to have hung out with William the Conqueror, that’s probably a red flag for regulators. [In a study](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gtc?mblid=441a3471da29&mbcid=34101066.3978341&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of 472 million shell companies, Moody’s Analytics found 21 million “red flags” that are potentially being used to commit financial crimes. One company listed its director at a spry 942 years old. Another reported over $2 billion in revenue in 2019 despite only having one employee. Thousands of companies have directors either older than 123 or younger than five. Others registered their addresses at the Egyptian pyramids. Though many shell companies run legitimate businesses, Moody’s says that cracking down on these improprieties would help cut into the $1.6 trillion that’s laundered annually.

**Quote:** “I’m aspirationally Jewish.”

Elon Musk aspires to many things—putting humans on Mars, implanting chips into our brains, and, apparently, being Jewish. The billionaire was attending a [conference on antisemitism](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gtd?mblid=52864756ad9e&mbcid=34101066.3978341&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in Krakow, Poland, when he made the comment shortly after he visited the Auschwitz concentration camp, where more than a million Jews were killed during the Holocaust. Musk was criticized last year for seemingly endorsing an antisemitic post on X and for allowing antisemitism and other bigoted content to thrive on the platform following his 2022 acquisition. At the conference, Musk also said he’s “Jewish by association” because he has Jewish friends.

3. The actress with the most best actress wins
4. The actor with the most best actor wins
5. The youngest winner of best original screenplay
6. Three films have won the Big Five Academy Awards (best picture, director, actor, actress, and screenplay). Can you name one of them?

### ANSWER

1. Walt Disney
2. _Shrek_
3. Katharine Hepburn won four times (one was a tie with Barbra Streisand in 1969).
4. Daniel Day-Lewis won three times.
5. Ben Affleck was 25 when he won the award for _Good Will Hunting_ with Matt Damon, who is two years older than Affleck.
