# Full Content: 

Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. So this is one of my favorite books. It's called someday is today and it's filled with incredibly actionable Helpful practical advice for achieving more of the things we want in life It's written by an incredible guy called matthew dix who has survived three near-death experiences including a ridiculously bad car crash and also being held at gunpoint at the age of 22 and these Experiences forced him to reconsider what he was doing with his life and what he achieved and he went from being someone who was completely Broke living in his car and working at mcdonald's to becoming a best-selling author world champion storyteller and award-winning journalist I was sure that I was going to die that day and I will tell you that I did not feel fear Or sadness or anger the only feeling I was consumed with was regret I was 22 years old and I had failed to do anything with my life That I had wanted to do that was a quote from a podcast that I did with matthew a few months ago incredible episode But in this episode of book club Which is the ongoing series where we distill and discuss highlights and summaries from some of my favorite books I'm going to talk through seven actionable tips that I took from his latest book someday is today These are seven tips that will help you achieve more of what you want in life. Let's get into it Tip number one the parking lot practice. So when I first started writing my book feel good productivity I felt like I had to do it in the right environment I felt like I had to go into a coffee shop and have my little latte next to me and my headphones on and I wanted the environment to be perfect Otherwise, you know for some reason I felt this writer's block and I felt like I couldn't do the thing But matthew's approach to this is completely different and his approach has actually changed the way that I approach my creative work And I think you can get a lot of value from this as well And one of my favorite quotes from the book is that productivity is not pretty now We've all seen those examples of like, you know The students that are like doing their notes and like the most elaborate colorful method possible. We've seen those sketch notes We've seen all these people with their like incredibly pretty desks and everything and it just Looks like such a productive vibe and it looks very pretty But the point that matthew is making is that true productivity does not have to look pretty and the example that he talks about In the book is where he was early for a dentist appointment And so instead of just sort of waiting in the car or like scrolling tiktok Whatever the thing was instead of doing that he decided to just sit on the side of the road in the parking lot Get out his laptop and continue writing some more of the novel that he was working on during world war one There were men in trenches wearing gas masks artillery exploding over their heads and they were scribbling in little books in journals Hoping that if they survived this battle and the many battles that were to come someday, they might publish something So thank goodness that the writers of the 1910s did not require starbucks smooth jazz And two hour quiet blocks of time for them to get their work done His point is that there's never going to be a perfect place or a perfect setting to get things done Especially when your life is chaotic, especially when you have kids I don't have kids but he does and so he would know and if you're always waiting for the right time or the right Environment to be able to do a thing that propels your creative life forward or to do a thing that you really want to Do you're going to be waiting for a very very very long time. It's the same with eating healthily It's the same with going to the gym. It's the same with building a business The timing is never going to be right The time is now the time is never and the people who can take action on the things that they want to do Despite the imperfect environment are the ones who ultimately succeed and ultimately move forward with what they want in life Tip number two the minutes mindset So the point here is that when we plan out our day We tend to think in blocks of hours But thinking in hours can actually cause us to waste quite a lot of time now in the book He talks about this and this is one of my favorite stories in any book that i've ever read He talks about how he was meeting up with a person who wanted to write a book and he was meeting up with her for breakfast She met me at the mcdonald's and she was late And so when she sat down I said tell me what your plan what you're doing and she started describing this book And then eventually I said as I always say to writers I say so how much have you written? And so often almost always the answer is oh, well, I haven't started writing anything yet And I then I said to her I said well you were seven minutes late today and she said i'm sorry, you know She i'm so sorry. I'm like no. No, my point was not that you were seven minutes late and I was upset My point was I used the seven minutes that you were late to write some sentences, you know, I turned my computer I said this is what I wrote in the seven minutes that you were late And I just absolutely love this approach like after matthew's near-death experiences He says that he realized the profound value of time and he didn't want to come to the end of his life with regret For failing to achieve the things that he actually wanted to do And so what he tries to do now is he tries to get the most out of every single minute rather than every single hour I tell all of the creative people of the world 10 minutes is precious to you It doesn't mean in 10 minutes. I can write a chapter in 10 minutes I can reread the last three paragraphs I wrote earlier today And see if they're okay and clean them up a little bit or I can write five good new sentences And this is actually how I was able to grow this youtube channel while I was working for two years full-time as a doctor This book hadn't come out yet But at that time I had a similar attitude in that in between patients Or in my lunch break or in a random break here and there When I had a few minutes of time I would get out my phone or I would go on notion on the windows computers at work And I would just make a few more notes on a video that I was working on And so what that meant is that in these little blocks of time here and there throughout the day Where other people around me were scrolling tik tok on their phones or whatever in those moments I was writing more bullet points for a video or fleshing out some title ideas or figuring out a thumbnail and in this context Me and matthew are absolutely not saying that there is no time for a break and that you should never ever recharge and relax In fact, my whole the whole final three chapters of my book feel good productivity are all about the power of rest and relaxation To make things sustainable over time But the way to think about this is that what do you find yourself doing in those pockets of time? Do you wait until it hits like five o'clock to be able to do something because you have to start on the hour? What if you just had three minutes or five or seven or nine minutes left? Could you do something intentional and effective and enjoyable with that time rather than wasting that time on scrolling? Whatever thing that you tend to default to oh and by the way One of the productivity tools that I use every single day that really helps me make the most of my time Is what I call the year at a glance spreadsheet It's basically a google sheet that has the entire year laid out and it's a way of visualizing the calendar that you just don't really Get within calendar apps and there's going to be a link in the video description where you can download this completely for free If you want a better way for planning your year as well All right Tip number three is the lily pad method now in the book matthew writes that the only real failure for any creator is to stop Making stuff now by making stuff it could be writing. It could be youtube videos. It could be studying for your exam It could be learning to code it could be starting that business or working on your sales script So, you know this all of this stuff is what I would call creative in some ways But sometimes doing this stuff can feel really overwhelming especially with everything else going on in our lives especially if you have a big project that you're working on like trying to study for a massive exam or like trying to write a Novel or trying to start a business and get it off the ground There's often a lot of little steps involved in that thing But if you look at the whole thing it can seem like a mountain that feels very daunting to climb Now normally the conventional path towards working towards our goals is to do things in sequence in order one at a time But the lily pad method is kind of matthew's approach to this which is to recognize that you don't actually need to start at the Beginning and you don't need to finish at the end. You can in fact jump around I think sometimes people see a goal or a dream as a linear process Like a to b to c and I think that's always a mistake too So I was working with someone yesterday who said I want to write a memoir And I said we'll start writing a memoir And she said I don't know where to start And I said do you have some good moments that you know, you want to include she said? Oh, yeah I said we'll write those she said don't you have to start a book at the beginning? I said no you write something just write chapter 15 if that's what you can write today. So seeing your dream as Stepping stones, but you get to touch whichever one you want at any point because you're gonna have to touch all of them Eventually, that's really helpful So if you figure out what is the goal that you're trying to go for and then you break it down into these tasks But instead of seeing these tasks as things that you had that have to happen in sequence If you can think of them as almost like lily pads where you can sort of leapfrog around these different lily pads depending on your mood and depending on how you're feeling then in those moments where you feel overwhelmed by a particular task or you Feel like you don't have the motivation or the discipline or whatever you want to call it You can then just leapfrog to another lily pad and you can make progress in that direction I also did an interview with writer mo gaudat who's written a bunch of books. He's amazing He's like a world expert in happiness happiness research stuff like that But I asked him about his writing habit and how he managed to write so many books And what he said was that he always works on like five or six different books in parallel And so every day he spent a few hours writing I wake up sometimes in the morning and I write for Three four five hours, but every morning he asks himself Which is the project that I feel most pulled right now to be working on and he just works on that one I loved the journey of writing it. I loved the journey of exploration. I loved the analysis the research I love the conversation I had with a friend to say does this make sense to you? I love all of that and it's you know what it's it's hours of my life that are filled with joy He's not forcing himself to stick to one particular project or one particular task in a way He leapfrogs around depending on how his energy is going on a particular day And so the question to ask yourself to take something away from this point is When it comes to the goals that i'm pursuing How might I be able to start in the middle with some of them rather than necessarily starting at the beginning and in moments? Where I feel overwhelmed with a particular task Is there a way I can leapfrog that particular task and do something else that takes me towards my goals? Okay, tip number four is the horizon habit now You've probably heard of smart goals, which is goals that are specific measurable attainable or assignable realistic or relevant and t for time bound But the problem with setting these sorts of goals is that often we can set them towards things that are actually outside of our control Like if you want to start a youtube channel, but you set a specific goal of hitting a million subscribers Which is specific and measurable and time bound and all that kind of stuff It's a goal that's kind of out of your control And so it can be very demotivating trying to get there And so the way Matthew thinks about this is setting horizon goals instead and I really like this way of thinking about it Because the way I think about goals is that goals are ultimately just a destination. They don't actually help us get there They're just the destination and so horizon goals are just a way of taking the pressure off the idea of goal setting and explicitly Allowing us to set a general vague directional goal. That's like over there on the horizon, but it's not really that specific I like to identify that idea of i'm going to be a storyteller But that i'm going to be a storyteller also allows because it's on the horizon to be maybe i'll teach storytelling someday Maybe i'll be a consultant about storytelling. Maybe Maybe an advertising company will allow me to Inject storytelling into their car commercials, which is what i've done, right? All of those things are sort of on the storytelling horizon But it affords me the opportunity to be flexible in terms of what ultimately is going to happen So if your goal is to be a musician you might think about all the other ways you can incorporate that dream into your career You could become a band member But you could also try songwriting or dj-ing or radio presenting you could learn how to produce music and become a technician or a background Singer who picks up an event management job or a teacher or an online creator sharing insights into the music world All of these jobs are crucially on the music horizon But this flexibility gives you both freedom and also resilience which brings us to the next point in the book Which is tip number five the piano precedent and there's a great quote from the book Which is that five year plans are inviting the universe to drop a piano on you Basically, if you try and meticulously plan out your life Then it's inevitable that something is going to happen that will completely ruin your plans Now that's not to say that planning is not important because making a plan is generally quite helpful And we've talked about setting a horizon goal as your destination so you can start working towards it and generally, you know When I find people come to me for life advice and I ask them Well, what do you actually want? They don't really have a vision of where they actually want to go and it's like that quote from Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland if you don't know where you're going then any road will get you there But I just wanted to ask you which way I ought to go well That depends on where You want to get to oh, it really doesn't matter as long as I can It really doesn't matter which way You go And there's a graph that I really like I think I think it's from Derren Brown's book happy which is basically all about stoicism Which is where you've got your plans on one axis and then you've got fate on the other axis and the path that your life Takes is sort of somewhere in between these two things You're very unlikely to always be going in the same direction as your plans but equally having some sort of plan will allow you to not just be completely buffeted by the winds of fate and you'll be Able to sort of chart your ship in those in those waters of fate tip number six the 100 year old plan Now in Matthew Dix's thingy I think it's one of the early chapters in his book, which I really liked which is that when you're at a crossroads in life Try to imagine your 100 year old self and think to yourself What advice would my 100 year old self give to me right now? Now the example that he uses is where he's sitting at his desk and he's writing and he's got deadlines He's got work and he's got stuff to do But then his son comes up to him and asks him to play tag now one option in that path is to continue with work Because you've got to be disciplined and you can't be distracted and you've got to focus but then he thinks what would his 100 year old Self want him to do and his 100 year old self is always going to say look man Go play with the kid because there's going to come a day where the kid no longer wants to play with you And you want to take advantage of the moments where the kid is actually keen to play tag with you now Similarly alex formosi's approach to this he calls it the solomon project is when he does journaling But he imagines the journaling session as a conversation between him and his 86 year old self a practice that I started doing Which is I have a coaching session with myself weird I have a conversation with my future self who's 85 and I ask him for advice on what I should do now And he knows that the 86 year old has context on where where he is at right now and what his goals are and what? He needs and he knows that the advice that the 86 year old gives him is going to be Well the right advice and again There's so much value in this kind of thinking right because the more short-term we think of our life trajectory And the more short-term our decision making the more we tend to make decisions based on what's urgent rather than what's actually important Honestly, this is still something I really struggle with far too often when it's a choice between friends and work I'll think oh, but work's really fun and i've got this deadline i've got you know I've got all this stuff and so i'll choose work when actually I know that my older self will have wanted me to choose Friends or family or relationships or health in that moment and tip number seven is the purposeful approach now Often when we talk about productivity and this is fundamentally a productivity book It's easy to default to thinking that productivity means work or hustling or business or money, you know that kind of stuff But sometimes we need to take a step back and really think about why we want to get things done efficiently So when people say productivity sort of grinds you down I think of productivity as it's the thing that you want to be doing that you should be doing more of so let's Maximize our life the things we have to do in order to sustain life In order to get to the things we want to do So we don't have to think of productivity in terms of work So the way I think of it is that I want to be making the most of my time Not for its own sake or not because I want to maximize economic output But actually by making the most of my time it frees me up to be able to spend my time doing the things that truly Matter to me and this is why Matthew is a big fan of what he calls soft goals Which are things that aren't necessarily productive if you look at like the standard definitions of productivity But that are intentional and that are meaningful to us anyway So the action point here is figure out what are the soft goals that you want to aim for in life? What are the things that like someone else looking at it might not think it's particularly productive but for you, it's very intentional It's very satisfying and it brings you the sense of meaning and fulfillment I was talking to a client the other day and I said, well, what's your horizon goal? And she said I want to see the 50 greatest movies of all time. There's a list in the world I'd have the list and I want to sit on my couch and watch the 50 greatest movies She said but that doesn't feel super productive And I said that sounds incredibly productive to me because it's your dream. Let's make sure we maximize your work time your chore time Let's take away all of those little black holes of your life that you're wasting And make sure that we use all that so you can get your ass On the couch more often with your husband watching black and white movies And so now if you can be really productive in the areas of your life like your work or like your studies or whatever the Thing might be you free yourself up you unlock a lot more time and energy to be able to give to the things that truly Matter to you now as you might know I am completely obsessed with reading productivity books, which is why I ended up actually writing one link down below But if you're interested in my top insights from most of the productivity books I read check out this video over here, which summarizes 2007 productivity books that i've read into a nine-step framework That you can use to level up your productivity and do more of the things that matter to you So thank you so much for watching and i'll see you hopefully in the next video.

嘿朋友们，欢迎回到频道。所以这是我最喜欢的书之一。这本书的名字叫“有一天就是今天”，它充满了令人难以置信的可操作的实用建议，帮助我们实现生活中更多想要的东西。它的作者是一位名叫马修·迪克斯的令人难以置信的人，他经历了三次濒临死亡的经历，包括一场严重的车祸和被困。 22岁时，他被枪指着，这些经历迫使他重新考虑自己的人生和所取得的成就，他从一个住在车里、在麦当劳工作的彻底破产的人，变成了一名畅销书作家作家世界冠军讲故事者和获奖记者我确信那天我会死，我会告诉你我没有感到恐惧或悲伤或愤怒我唯一的感觉是后悔我22岁了我一生都没能做任何我想做的事，这是几个月前我和马修一起做的播客中的一段令人难以置信的插曲，但在读书俱乐部的这一集中，这是我们提炼和讨论的正在进行的系列我最喜欢的一些书籍的亮点和摘要 今天我将从他的最新书中摘录七个可行的技巧，这些技巧将帮助您在生活中实现更多目标。让我们开始讨论第一个技巧：停车场实践。 因此，当我第一次开始写我的书时，我感觉生产力很高，我觉得我必须在正确的环境中完成它，我觉得我必须走进一家咖啡店，把我的小拿铁咖啡放在我旁边，戴上耳机，我想要环境要完美 否则，你知道，出于某种原因，我感到这位作家的障碍，我觉得我无法完成这件事，但马修的方法完全不同，他的方法实际上改变了我处理创意工作的方式我认为你也可以从中获得很多价值，书中我最喜欢的引用之一是，现在的生产力并不高，我们都见过这样的例子，你知道，学生们喜欢做笔记，就像最精致的色彩方法一样。 我们已经看到了那些草图笔记，我们已经看到所有这些人都拥有非常漂亮的办公桌和所有东西，它看起来像是一种富有成效的氛围，而且看起来非常漂亮，但马修所要表达的观点是，真正的生产力并不具有看起来很漂亮，他在书中提到的例子是他提前去看牙医，所以他没有在车里等待，也没有像滚动抖音那样，不管发生了什么，他决定只是坐着在停车场的路边 拿出他的笔记本电脑，继续写他在第一次世界大战期间正在写的小说 战壕中的士兵戴着防毒面具，大炮在他们的头顶上爆炸，他们在小纸上乱写乱画期刊上的书 希望如果他们能在这场战斗以及将来的许多战斗中幸存下来，他们可能会出版一些东西所以谢天谢地，1910 年代的作家不需要星巴克流畅的爵士乐和两个小时安静的时间来获得他们的工作完成了 他的观点是，永远不会有一个完美的地方或完美的环境来完成工作，尤其是当你的生活混乱时，尤其是当你有孩子时，我没有孩子，但他有，所以他会知道并且如果你总是在等待合适的时间或合适的环境去做一件能够推动你的创意生活前进的事情，或者做一件你真正想做的事情，你会等待一个非常非常非常的事情吗？很久。健康饮食是一样的，去健身房也是一样。 创业也是一样，时机永远不会是正确的，现在是时候，时机永远不会到来，那些能够在不完美的环境下采取行动做自己想做的事情的人，才是最终成功的人。朝着他们想要的生活前进 秘诀二：分钟心态 所以这里的重点是，当我们计划一天时 我们倾向于以几个小时的时间来思考 但以小时为单位的思考实际上会导致我们现在浪费很多时间在书中他谈到了这一点，这是我读过的任何书中我最喜欢的故事之一他谈到他如何与一个想写书的人会面，并且他正在与她一起吃早餐她在麦当劳遇见了我，她迟到了所以当她坐下时我说告诉我你的计划你在做什么然后她开始描述这本书最后我说就像我总是对作家说的那样我说多少你写了吗？通常，答案几乎总是哦，好吧，我还没有开始写任何东西然后我对她说我说好吧你今天迟到了七分钟，她说对不起，你知道她我非常抱歉。我就像不。 不，我的意思不是你迟到了七分钟，我很沮丧，我的意思是我利用你迟到的七分钟写了一些句子，你知道，我打开了我的电脑，我说这是我在七分钟里写的你迟到了几分钟我非常喜欢这种方法，就像马修的濒死经历一样，他说他意识到了时间的深刻价值，他不想因为未能实现目标而带着遗憾结束生命他真正想做的事情所以他现在尝试做的是他试图充分利用每一分钟而不是每一个小时我告诉世界上所有有创造力的人10分钟对你来说很珍贵它并不不是说10分钟之内。 我可以在 10 分钟内写一章 我可以重读我今天早些时候写的最后三段 看看它们是否还好并稍微清理一下或者我可以写五个好的新句子 这实际上就是我能够做到的当我作为一名全职医生工作了两年的时候，我发展了这个 YouTube 频道 这本书还没有出版 但当时我在病人之间 或者在我的午休时间 或者在这里的随机休息时间也有类似的态度当我有几分钟的时间时，我会拿出手机，或者在工作时在 Windows 电脑上继续思考，我会在我正在制作的视频上再做一些笔记，这意味着什么是在一天中的这些小块时间里，当我周围的其他人在手机上滚动抖音或其他什么的时候，我正在为视频写更多的要点，或者充实一些标题想法，或者想出一个缩略图，在这种情况下，我和马修绝对不是说没有时间休息，永远不应该充电和放松。事实上，我在本书的最后三章中都觉得良好的生产力都与力量有关。休息和放松 让事情随着时间的推移可持续发展 但思考这个问题的方法是，你发现自己在这些时间里做了什么？你是否会等到五点钟才可以做某事，因为你必须准点开始？如果你只剩下三分钟、五分钟、七分钟或九分钟怎么办？您能否利用这段时间做一些有意识、有效且令人愉快的事情，而不是将时间浪费在滚动上？ 无论你倾向于默认什么，哦，顺便说一句，我每天使用的生产力工具之一，真正帮助我充分利用我的时间，就是我所说的“年度概览电子表格”，它基本上是一个谷歌表格，列出了全年，这是一种可视化日历的方式，您只是在日历应用程序中无法真正获得，并且视频说明中会有一个链接，您可以在其中免费完整下载如果您想要更好的方式好吧，第三个技巧是书中现在的睡莲叶方法，马修写道，对于任何创作者来说，唯一真正的失败就是停止现在通过制作它可以写的东西来制作东西。可能是 YouTube 视频。它可以是为考试而学习 可以是学习编码 可以是开始这项业务或编写销售脚本 所以，你知道所有这些东西在某些方面都是我所说的创意 但有时做这些东西会让人感觉真的让人不知所措，尤其是当我们生活中发生的其他事情时，尤其是如果你正在做一个大项目，比如尝试学习准备大型考试，或者尝试写一本小说，或者尝试创业并摆脱困境。地面 这件事通常涉及很多小步骤 但如果你看整个事情，它看起来就像一座令人畏惧的山，爬起来感觉非常令人畏惧 现在通常实现我们目标的传统路径是按顺序做事一次一个 但是睡莲叶法是马修的一种方法，它是认识到您实际上不需要从头开始，也不需要在最后完成。 事实上你可以跳来跳去 我想有时人们将目标或梦想视为一个线性过程 就像a到b到c 我认为这也总是一个错误 所以我昨天和一个人一起工作，他说我想写一本回忆录我说我们要开始写回忆录，她说我不知道​​从哪里开始，我说你有一些美好的时刻，你想包括在内吗？她说？哦，是的，我说我们会写她说的那些，你不必从头开始写一本书吗？我说不，你写点东西就写第15章吧，如果那是你今天能写的。所以把你的梦想看作垫脚石，但你可以在任何时候触及你想要的任何一个，因为你最终必须触及所有这些，这真的很有帮助所以如果你弄清楚你正在尝试的目标是什么然后你把它分解成这些任务 但是不要把这些任务看作是你必须按顺序发生的事情 如果你可以把它们想象成几乎就像睡莲叶，你可以在这些不同的百合花周围跳跃根据你的心情和你的感受，当你对某个特定的任务感到不知所措，或者你觉得你没有动力或纪律或任何你想称之为的东西时，你可以跨越到另一个睡莲叶，你可以朝这个方向取得进展 我还采访了作家莫高达，他写了很多书。 他太棒了 他就像是幸福幸福研究方面的世界专家 但我问他的写作习惯以及他如何写出这么多书 他说他总是同时写五六本不同的书所以每天他都会花几个小时写作，我有时早上醒来，写三四五个小时，但每天早上他都会问自己，我觉得现在最需要做的项目是什么，他只是工作关于这一点，我喜欢写它的过程。我喜欢探索之旅。我喜欢分析和研究，我喜欢与朋友的对话，我想知道这对你有意义吗？我喜欢这一切，你知道这是什么，我生命中充满快乐的时光他不会强迫自己以某种方式坚持一个特定的项目或一项特定的任务，他会根据自己的精力如何进行跳跃式跳跃。因此，要问自己从这一点上采取一些措施的问题是，当谈到我正在追求的目标时，我如何能够从其中一些目标开始，而不是必须从头开始，瞬间？当我对某项特定任务感到不知所措时，有没有一种方法可以让我跳过该特定任务，去做其他事情来实现我的目标？ 好的，第四个技巧是视野习惯，你可能听说过“聪明的目标”，这些目标是具体的、可衡量的、可实现的、可分配的、现实的或相关的，并且有时间限制。但设定这些目标的问题是，我们常常可以将它们设置为实际上超出我们控制范围的事情，就像你想创建一个 YouTube 频道，但你设定了一个达到 100 万订阅者的具体目标，这是具体的、可衡量的、有时间限制的，等等，这是一个目标这有点超出你的控制范围所以尝试达到目标可能会非常令人沮丧所以马修思考这个问题的方式是设定地平线目标而我真的很喜欢这种思考方式因为我思考目标的方式是目标最终只是一个目的地。它们实际上并不能帮助我们到达目标，它们只是目的地，因此地平线目标只是减轻目标设定想法压力的一种方式，并明确允许我们设定一个总体模糊的方向性目标。这就像在地平线上，但并不是那么具体，我喜欢确定我将成为一个讲故事的人的想法，但我将成为一个讲故事的人也允许，因为它就在地平线上，也许我有一天我会教讲故事，也许我会成为一名讲故事的顾问。也许广告公司会允许我在他们的汽车广告中注入讲故事的内容，这就是我所做的，对吗？ 所有这些事情都在讲故事的地平线上，但它为我提供了对最终将要发生的事情保持灵活的机会，所以如果你的目标是成为一名音乐家，你可能会考虑所有其他可以融入这一点的方式梦想进入你的职业生涯你可以成为一名乐队成员但你也可以尝试歌曲创作或打碟或广播节目你可以学习如何制作音乐并成为一名技术人员或背景歌手，从事活动管理工作或教师或在线创作者分享对音乐世界的见解所有这些工作都在音乐领域至关重要但是这种灵活性给了你自由和弹性，这将我们带到了本书的下一点，这是钢琴先例的第五点，有一个伟大的书中引用的内容是，五年计划正在邀请宇宙向你扔一架钢琴基本上，如果你尝试精心计划你的生活，那么不可避免地会发生一些事情，彻底破坏你的计划现在这不是说计划并不重要，因为制定计划通常非常有帮助 我们已经讨论过设定一个地平线目标作为你的目的地，这样你就可以开始朝着它努力，一般来说，你知道当我发现人们向我寻求生活建议和我问他们好吧，你到底想要什么？ 他们并不真正了解自己真正想去的地方，就像刘易斯·卡罗尔的《爱丽丝梦游仙境》中的那句话，如果你不知道你要去哪里，那么任何道路都会带你到达那里但我只是想问你我应该走哪条路好 这取决于你想去哪里 哦，只要我能做到，这真的不重要 你走哪条路真的不重要 而且有一个我真的很喜欢的图表我认为这是来自达伦·布朗（Derren Brown）的《快乐》一书，这本书基本上都是关于斯多葛主义的，即你在一个轴上有你的计划，然后你在另一个轴上有命运，而你的生活所走的道路是介于两者之间的。这两件事你不太可能总是朝着与你的计划相同的方向前进，但同样地，拥有某种计划将使你不仅完全受到命运之风的打击，而且你将能够制定某种图表你的船在命运的水域里第六条一百年前的计划现在在马修·迪克斯的作品中我认为这是他书中的早期章节之一，我真的很喜欢当你处于人生的十字路口时试着想象一下 100 岁的自己，并思考一下 100 岁的自己现在会给我什么建议？ 现在他用的例子是，他坐在办公桌前，正在写作，他有最后期限，他有工作，他有事情要做，但后来他的儿子走到他面前，要求他玩捉迷藏，现在这条路上的一个选择是继续工作，因为你必须遵守纪律，不能分心，必须集中注意力，但他会想，100 岁的自己会希望他做什么，而 100 岁的自己总是会继续工作说，看吧，伙计，去和孩子一起玩吧，因为总有一天孩子会不再想和你一起玩，而你想要利用孩子现在实际上热衷于和你玩捉迷藏的时刻，类似地，亚历克斯福尔莫西的对此，他称之为所罗门项目，就是他写日记的时候，但他把写日记想象成他和86岁的自己之间的对话，这是我开始做的一种练习，我和自己进行了一次辅导，很奇怪，我有一个与未来 85 岁的自己交谈，我向他请教我现在应该做什么，他知道 86 岁的他知道自己现在所处的位置以及他的目标是什么以及什么？他需要，而且他知道这位 86 岁的老人给他的建议将是正确的建议，而且这种正确的想法非常有价值，因为我们对自己的人生轨迹思考得越短期，就越有价值。短期的我们的决策越倾向于根据紧急的事情而不是实际重要的事情做出决定老实说，当我在朋友和工作之间做出选择时，这仍然是我经常遇到的问题，我会想哦，但是工作真的很有趣，而且我有这个截止日期，我让你知道我已经拥有了所有这些东西，所以我会选择工作，而实际上我知道我年长的自己会希望我选择朋友或家人或人际关系或那一刻的健康和提示七是现在有目的的方法通常，当我们谈论生产力时，这基本上是一本生产力书，很容易默认认为生产力意味着工作或忙碌或生意或金钱，你知道这些东西但是有时我们需要退后一步，真正思考为什么我们想要高效地完成工作所以当人们说生产力有点让你沮丧时，我认为生产力是因为它是你想做的事情，你应该做得更多所以让我们最大化我们的生活为了维持生活我们必须做的事情为了得到我们想做的事情所以我们不必从工作的角度考虑生产力所以我的想法是我想充分利用我的时间 不是为了它本身，也不是因为我想最大化经济产出 但实际上，通过充分利用我的时间，它让我能够腾出时间来做真正有意义的事情对我来说很重要，这就是为什么马修非常喜欢他所说的软目标，这些目标很薄弱如果你看看生产力的标准定义，这些并不一定是生产力的，但这是有意的，而且无论如何对我们来说都是有意义的。所以这里的行动点是弄清楚你在生活中想要实现的软目标是什么？有哪些事情别人看可能不会认为它特别有成效，但对你来说，它是非常有意的，它非常令人满意，它给你带来意义和成就感，我前几天和一个客户交谈时，我说，好吧，你的目标是什么？她说我想看有史以来最伟大的 50 部电影。世界上有一个清单，我有这个清单，我想坐在沙发上看 50 部最伟大的电影，她说，但这感觉不太高效，我说，这对我来说听起来非常高效，因为这是你的梦想。 让我们确保最大限度地利用您的工作时间和杂务时间让我们消除您生活中浪费的所有小黑洞并确保我们利用所有这些，这样您就可以更频繁地与您的丈夫一起坐在沙发上观看黑白电影 所以现在，如果你能够在生活的各个领域（例如工作、学习或其他任何事情）真正富有成效，那么你就可以释放自己，从而释放更多的时间和精力你可能知道，现在对你真正重要的事情我完全沉迷于阅读生产力书籍，这就是为什么我最终在下面写了一个链接但是如果你对我从大多数生产力书籍中获得的最重要的见解感兴趣我在这里读了这个视频，它总结了我读过的 2007 年生产力书籍，形成了一个九步框架，您可以用它来提高您的生产力并做更多对您来说重要的事情所以非常感谢您正在观看，希望在下一个视频中见到您。 Bye

> Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/pdf-e-pub-txt-immersive-translation-document-translation-one-cli-18e6d8805b5#fd0d1c12-badd-4679-9f1d-b7b8bacc2f68)  ^fd0d1c12

这段文字是一位YouTube博主分享的关于他最喜欢的书籍《有一天就是今天》的书评和总结。作者马修·迪克斯通过自己的亲身经历，包括三次濒临死亡的经历，以及从破产到成为畅销书作家的转变，向读者提供了实用的建议，帮助他们实现生活中更多的目标。

以下是博主从书中提取的七个实用技巧：

1. **停车场实践**：不要等待完美的环境来完成工作。即使在不完美的环境下，也可以开始行动并取得进展。

2. **分钟心态**：利用碎片化的时间，即使是几分钟，也可以完成一些小任务，而不是等到有大段时间才开始工作。

3. **睡莲叶方法**：不要将目标视为线性过程，而是将其分解成小任务，并根据情况灵活地在不同任务之间跳跃。

4. **视野习惯**：设定地平线目标，即一个总体的方向性目标，而不是过于具体的目标，以便保持灵活性。

5. **钢琴先例**：避免制定过于详细的五年计划，因为生活中不可预见的事件可能会打乱计划。

6. **一百年前的计划**：想象自己在未来的某个时间点，从那个角度考虑现在应该做什么，以便做出更有意义的决策。

7. **有目的的方法**：确定生活中的软目标，即那些可能看起来不那么高效，但对你个人来说非常有意义和满足的事情。

博主还提到了他自己的YouTube频道和如何通过有效利用时间来平衡工作和个人生活。他鼓励观众思考自己在生活的不同领域中如何提高生产力，以便有更多时间去做对自己真正重要的事情。最后，博主提到了他读过的2007年的生产力书籍，并总结了一个九步框架，帮助观众提高生产力。



在《有一天就是今天》这本书中，“视野习惯”和“钢琴先例”是两种独特的方法，旨在帮助人们以更灵活和现实的方式设定和实现目标。

**视野习惯**：
这种方法鼓励人们设定所谓的“地平线目标”，而不是传统的SMART目标（具体的、可衡量的、可实现的、相关的、有时间限制的）。地平线目标更像是一个宽泛的方向或愿景，而不是具体、固定的成果。这种方法的核心思想是，目标应该指引方向而不是成为压力的来源。例如，如果你想成为一名讲故事的人，你的地平线目标可能是“成为一个会讲故事的人”，而不是“出版一本畅销书”。这样一来，你可以保持灵活性，探索多种途径来实现你的愿景，如教学、写作、演讲等，而不是局限于单一的具体目标。

**钢琴先例**：
这个概念是基于这样一个观点：如果你制定了一个长期的、详尽的计划，就像邀请宇宙向你扔一架钢琴，意味着你可能会面临意外的挑战和干扰。生活是不可预测的，过于详细的计划可能会因为突发事件而变得不切实际。相反，钢琴先例鼓励人们接受变化，保持计划的灵活性，以便能够适应生活中出现的意外情况。这种方法强调的是适应性和韧性，而不是严格遵守一个可能无法实现的计划。

总的来说，“视野习惯”和“钢琴先例”都强调了在设定和实现目标时保持灵活性和适应性的重要性。它们鼓励人们专注于长期的方向和愿景，而不是被具体的、可能无法实现的目标所束缚。通过这种方式，人们可以更容易地调整自己的行动，以应对生活中的变化，从而更有效地实现个人的长期愿望和目标。
