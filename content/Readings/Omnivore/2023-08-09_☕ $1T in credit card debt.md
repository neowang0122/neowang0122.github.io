**Good morning.** The writing gang is all in town for the Brew’s summer party this week, and after a randomized controlled trial lasting one day, we can conclude that in-person work does not boost productivity. But it does lead to a statistically significant rise in tossing around a ball and debating the various smells of NYC vs. Chicago from our desks.

\*Stock data as of market close, cryptocurrency data as of 2:00am ET.[Here's what these numbers mean.](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/s1?mbcid=32339653.4292892&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) 

* **Markets:** Stocks got roughed up yesterday after Moody’s [warned](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ate?mblid=db2e8bc83b74&mbcid=32339653.4292892&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the banking sector it was still on thin ice. The credit ratings agency downgraded 10 small and midsized banks, citing stress from higher interest rates, a potential recession in 2024, and struggling commercial real estate assets. Regional banks are still trying to shake off the jitters from SVB’s collapse in March.

The hyped anti-obesity drug from Novo Nordisk was found to [cut the risk](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atg?mblid=edec8e44bb10&mbcid=32339653.4292892&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of major cardiovascular events, such as stroke and heart attacks, by a whopping 20%, the company announced yesterday.

These findings, which came from a late-stage clinical trial, are important for two reasons:

1. They show that Wegovy could be more than a lifestyle drug that helps people shed pounds. It also has considerable benefits for heart disease, the No. 1 cause of death in the US.
2. And, given those wider benefits, insurance companies and Medicare could feel pressured to start covering the popular, pricey medication, which many insurers have avoided since it wasn’t deemed essential to overall health. Wegovy costs over $1,300 per month for weekly injections.

## The reaction: ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/18x0,s7ORbSLuFH05XIL34kyHO2uMCSg4931CR-kh48lrSHzg/https://em-content.zobj.net/thumbs/120/apple/237/person-raising-both-hands-in-celebration_1f64c.png) ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/18x0,shgMx9BKSt5SH9OdAaBRG7Oe0dcO_PC6BrvDDufSwTUE/https://em-content.zobj.net/thumbs/120/apple/237/face-with-party-horn-and-party-hat_1f973.png) ![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/18x0,sHZ8tlBM5H4FvtQA3oG7fNf_rBaNEpj8vzoLATV3ZM04/https://em-content.zobj.net/thumbs/120/apple/237/rocket_1f680.png)

“If they play baseball in Denmark, Wegovy just hit a home run,” Barclays analyst Emily Field [wrote](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ath?mblid=dd0e579ce6dc&mbcid=32339653.4292892&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), referencing Novo Nordisk’s Danish home base. (Just checked: They don’t seem to play much baseball in Denmark.)

Others went further, declaring these findings amounted to a [grand slam](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ati?mblid=9e4f738cf101&mbcid=32339653.4292892&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). The study means that Wegovy and a similar drug from Eli Lilly (Mounjaro) will easily become the “top-selling pharmaceuticals in history,” Barron’s gushed. And investors are betting they will be, too.

* Novo Nordisk [gained $60 billion](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atj?mblid=fe8070102da1&mbcid=32339653.4292892&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in market cap yesterday to close in on luxury conglomerate LVMH as Europe’s most valuable company, per Bloomberg.
* Eli Lilly also got a [big boost](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atk?mblid=cd78af55792f&mbcid=32339653.4292892&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) from its bullish earnings report and the Novo Nordisk results. Shares of the world’s largest healthcare company soared 15% to a record high yesterday.

**Big picture:** A new class of superdrug that significantly reduces weight, cuts the risk of heart attacks, and offers numerous other unexplored benefits (like [curbing addiction](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/74-?mblid=c35b004e94ab&mbcid=32339653.4292892&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)) could herald an exciting new era for public health.

But don’t count your chickens, etc., etc….Supply has been constrained amid a celebrity-powered frenzy for these drugs, there can be serious side effects, and the most recent study showing cardiovascular benefits hasn’t been peer-reviewed yet.—_NF_

ESPN, meanwhile, will create a sportsbook with Penn (named ESPN Bet) in a 10-year deal worth $2 billion—the network’s first big push into gambling. Following the news, Penn stock spiked \~13% in after-hours trading.

Americans are spending like they’re Isla Fisher in a 2009 rom-com. A new [report](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/att?mblid=7f22d6f88d97&mbcid=32339653.4292892&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that Americans charged more than ever to their credit cards last quarter, bringing credit card debt to over $1 trillion for the first time.

Booming credit card debt is the result of higher prices caused by inflation, rising interest rates, and strong consumer confidence, as well as 24 million new credit cards issued in the last quarter. 

* As debt has risen, so have late payments: The report found that in Q2, 7.2% of credit card accounts were 30 days overdue—the highest level in 11 years—and delinquency rates rose to 3.18% (up from 3%).

**Yes, but…**according to the Fed, neither of these numbers is shocking. Delinquency rates are returning to pre-pandemic levels after plummeting in 2020 when everyone collected stimulus checks and saved money.

**Big picture:** While $1 trillion in credit card debt seems alarming, economists are as unbothered as the guy holding up the line at Chipotle. Consumer debt is still just 6% of total deposits Americans have in their bank accounts, the [lowest](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atu?mblid=760832f5186b&mbcid=32339653.4292892&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) percentage in 20 years, per Axios. Plus, New York Fed researchers said, “There is little evidence of widespread financial distress for consumers.”—_CC_

Epic Games just approved a virtual Holocaust museum for its popular online video game _Fortnite_. It’s probably the last thing anyone would expect from the battle royale that lets users play as Optimus Prime and do a TikTok dance after 360-no-scoping a walking fish.

But the digital gallery’s designer, who also created the educational Holocaust game _The Light in the Darkness_, [tweeted](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atz?mblid=7d04519187f7&mbcid=32339653.4292892&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that this museum—existing separately from _Fortnite_’s main play—will be “game changing” for Holocaust awareness: _Fortnite_ has about 239 million active monthly users, according to ActivePlayer, and 80% of Americans have never visited a Holocaust museum, according to a 2018 study.

_Fortnite_ players who [visit](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atA?mblid=f55d01a9915c&mbcid=32339653.4292892&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the Voices of The Forgotten Museum…

* **Can:** Walk through exhibits resembling those found at in-person Holocaust museums, minus photos of dead bodies and concentration camps, which would violate the game’s age rating.
* **Cannot:** Use weapons, break anything, or dance. Epic learned its lesson after players kept doing the floss and the robot at a 2021 [in-game event](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atB?mblid=f1e6d0d6ad1b&mbcid=32339653.4292892&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.

**Stat:** Christopher Nolan’s _Oppenheimer_ has become the highest-grossing film set during World War II in history, passing _Dunkirk_ and _Saving Private Ryan_ with a $500+ million global box-office haul, CNN reports. Of course, if you adjust for inflation, _Oppenheimer_ is still behind the other two movies, but that’s less fun. Anyway, question for the audience: Ignoring box-office revenues…what’s the _best_ movie set during WWII? _Inglourious Basterds_? _Schindler’s List_?

**Quote:** “The Orioles have won more games against them this season than the last two combined.”

The baseball world is in an uproar over reports that the lead TV announcer for the Baltimore Orioles, Kevin Brown, was [suspended](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/atI?mblid=65c5fcb2019b&mbcid=32339653.4292892&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) by the team owner over his on-air comments in late July that mentioned how poorly the Orioles have historically played against the Tampa Bay Rays in Florida. Many fellow baseball announcers voiced their support for Brown and bashed the Orioles organization, which until this PR debacle was having a stellar season (they’re in first place in the AL East). The Orioles denied that a suspension took place and said, “We look forward to hearing Kevin’s voice soon.”
