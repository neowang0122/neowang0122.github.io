_Here are some illuminating scientific discoveries from the week to help you live better and maybe even have sympathy for the moth circling your porch light._

ü´• **A real-life invisibility cloak is in the works.** Your dream of sneaking into the Restricted Section of Hogwarts could soon be realized. Inspired by the camouflage techniques of chameleons, glass frogs, and bearded dragons, researchers in China have developed an experimental synthetic material that they say can [blend into surrounding environments](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gST?mblid=c6c12c880096&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) and evade radar and heat detection by manipulating electromagnetic waves. Once the wearable tech is more developed, the researchers say, it could be a boon for stealth military operations and environmental conservation (since going undetected helps observation efforts).

ü™∞ **Pests don‚Äôt actually like light‚Äîthey‚Äôre just lost.** Scientists have poked holes in the phrase ‚Äúlike a moth to a flame‚Äù with new research showing that flying insects only seem thirsty for your porch light because they‚Äôre trying to use it as a North Star of sorts. For most of the many eons that flies have buzzed around, the starry sky served as the brightest source of light at night, and many winged bugs still use it to know which way is up when navigating. So, when pests detect a glow from lampposts, for example, their [sense of direction](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gSU?mblid=77216dd893be&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) goes out the window, and their instinct to keep the light overhead traps them in an orbit. The researchers observed flying insects in Costa Rica and noted that many flipped upside down or crashed into other bugs while trying to keep their backs to an artificial light.

This question, long a discussion point in the dating scene, is much ado about nothing, according to researchers at the University of Toronto and York University, who discovered ‚Äú[very little evidence](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gSV?mblid=cf04de9157b1&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)‚Äù that having matching love languages made relationships any better. Instead, they found that people value all of the love languages in different situations and likely manifest their affections in additional ways that don‚Äôt fall under those categories. The five ‚Äúlove languages‚Äù were made popular more than 30 years ago in a book of the same name written by the Baptist preacher Gary Chapman, who‚Äôs been slammed for homophobia and misogyny.‚Äî_ML_

Elmo began the week as the victim of online trauma-dumping and ended the week as the victim of a violent attack from a deranged madman. An unprovoked [Larry David](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gSW?mblid=1d119c190f72&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) took a break from promoting the final season of _Curb Your Enthusiasm_‚Äîwhich premieres tonight‚Äîand assaulted Elmo during a live broadcast of _Today_ on Thursday. Elmo attempted to embrace his role as the world‚Äôs most famous uncredentialed therapist by asking David to sit on the couch to talk about his feelings, but the disagreeable _Seinfeld_ co-creator unsurprisingly rejected the heart-to-heart.

David eventually apologized, and Elmo accepted, but the entire incident should make the Muppets consider boycotting _Today_ and only appear on _Good Morning America_ because no way Michael Strahan lets that happen.

## [The breakthrough at Neuralink](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gSX?mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)

Elon Musk‚Äôs futuristic brain implant startup has been on everyone‚Äôs mind since the billionaire announced on X this week, ‚ÄúThe first human received an implant from [@Neuralink](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gSY?mblid=f9ed6b7922ea&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) yesterday and is recovering well.‚Äù

Beyond inspiring a torrent of cyberpunk [mind-control](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gSZ?mblid=abc40757000a&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) [jabs](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gS-?mblid=e3edf4624465&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), the news prompted some major head-scratching. While a successful implant procedure could lead to a revolutionary breakthrough, no information has been shared beyond the tweet. There‚Äôs been no independent confirmation and, despite its CEO‚Äôs social media reveal, Neuralink has kept mum.

Here‚Äôs what we know:

* Since its founding in 2016, the startup has been developing a microchip implant to enable people to control a phone or a computer with their thoughts.
* The FDA gave it the green light to test on humans last May, and the company began recruiting participants in the fall.
* While Musk claims Neuralink‚Äôs long-term goal is to turn users into AI-empowered cyborgs, the company‚Äôs first product‚Äîcalled Telepathy‚Äîis intended to help people with neurological disorders use digital devices. Musk said that ‚Äúinitial users will be those who have lost the use of their limbs.‚Äù

While there‚Äôs not much verifiable info about Neuralink‚Äôs work, the field of brain‚Äìcomputer interfaces (BCIs) and Neuralink‚Äôs track record of alleged [ethically dubious](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gS%5F?mblid=cf9b97bd6474&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) research practices provide a lot to think about. So, let‚Äôs wrap our minds around the cerebral endeavor.

## The nuts and bolts

Neuralink has developed a surgical robot (that, as Vox put it, functions a lot like a sewing machine) to implant a quarter-sized microchip into the part of the brain responsible for movement.

* The chip is meant to send neural signals to a phone or computer via Bluetooth, which could help someone with a motor disorder or a motor neuron disease move a cursor or type text messages.
* Neuralink says it also wants to help people with blindness by transmitting visual signals to their brain.

## Can it work?

Maybe. Scientists say that it‚Äôs hard to gauge Neuralink‚Äôs progress without seeing concrete data in a scientific paper. BCI researcher John Donoghue told Scientific American that he‚Äôs happy there‚Äôs promise of a commercial product that builds on research in the field‚Äîbut he warned that it‚Äôs too early to speak of any success.

Neuralink is also not alone in its quest to develop a cutting-edge BCI:

* The Bill Gates- and Jeff Bezos-backed startup Synchron has been testing its brain implant on patients since 2022.
* Researchers at Stanford University created a BCI that [allowed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gT1?mblid=10f704ec8554&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) a man with paralysis to imagine letters and transmit them to a computer screen.
* The Chinese government [established](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gT2?mblid=1aa0459996dc&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) a BCI lab last year. Also in China, scientists from Tsinghua University [developed a device](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gT3?mblid=8aee82beca88&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that connects to the brain through the inner ear.

But Neuralink claims its devices can [do more](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gT4?mblid=68bafda1ccb2&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) than its competitors‚Äô can. And while most companies in the space are working to create assistive devices for medical uses, Musk says he hopes Neuralink‚Äôs brain chip will eventually become a consumer product. 

## What could possibly go wrong?

Aside from the possibility of Musk one day using Neuralink to [broadcast](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gT5?mblid=5eaee7119209&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) X‚Äôs ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù feed into your brain 24/7, there are more immediate anxieties.

* Neuralink has been called out for allegedly sloppy research practices when testing its devices on pigs and monkeys. Some former employees accused the company of carelessness that has led to avoidable animal deaths.
* Those reports of negligence have raised concerns about patient safety during human trials.

Even without that baggage, some skeptics have expressed reservations about brain implant technology more generally: Testing volunteers can become incredibly reliant on the tech and might suffer if the trial ends and their implanted devices stop working. This happened in the case of patients who lost their eyesight when a retinal implant startup [ran out of cash](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gT6?mblid=cac6fc8b1db3&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

**Looking ahead‚Ä¶**even if Neuralink‚Äôs multiyear patient safety trial goes well, one expert told Reuters [it‚Äôll probably](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gT7?mblid=7b20c8fc3f9d&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) be over a decade until the $5 billion startup can start charging for implants._‚ÄîSK_

_It‚Äôs a big world out there. In this section, we‚Äôll teleport you to an interesting location‚Äîand hopefully give you travel ideas in the process._

Your last chance to see a total solar eclipse in the contiguous US until 2044 will be on April 8, which you‚Äôd think leaves plenty of time to plan your travel to the path of the eclipse. Unfortunately for you‚Äîthe casual celestial event enthusiast‚Äîeclipse-chasers took care of their plans months ago, leaving scarce and mostly expensive options for watching the moon pass between the sun and Earth.

While that sounds bleak, the travel opportunities are nowhere near as dark as the skies will be for 4.5 minutes that day.

**Where will the eclipse be most visible?** Much like cutaways to Taylor Swift during NFL games, the ‚Äúpath of totality‚Äù will split the country nearly in half, with skygazing options stretching from Texas to Maine. While it‚Äôs possible to predict the path of totality, prognosticating clear skies is more difficult‚ÄîAxios looked at average cloud cover over the past 30 years and found that [Texas](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gTb?mblid=ee5f328d84c4&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) tends to be the best bet for an unblemished view.

**The view won‚Äôt come cheap.** Hotel prices in Texas have increased 390%, while Airbnb reported that some residences in the path of totality have raised rates to more than $1,000 per night. One home in Texas was listed on Airbnb for [$1,789 a night,](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gTc?mblid=25fec6f177d6&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) a 1,100% increase over the previous month, per the WSJ.

**It doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have options.** A ‚Äú[Total Eclipse of the Park](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gTd?mblid=954bcff1859e&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)‚Äù event in Addison, Texas, is an example of an off-the-beaten-path-of-totality option expected to have a smaller crowd.

For a more communal experience, places like the [Indianapolis Motor Speedway](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gTf?mblid=a7503887bb1c&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) and [Great Lakes Science Center](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gTg?mblid=ae8dfa5cf10b&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in Cleveland have festivities scheduled throughout the day.

While in Cleveland, you could also attend the Guardians‚Äô [home opener](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gTh?mblid=f02821812bc4&mbcid=34218046.3981709&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), which is scheduled to coincide with the eclipse that afternoon.‚Äî_DL_

## This week‚Äôs question

Imagine this: It‚Äôs the morning of Monday, February 12, and the Super Bowl took place last night. What shocking moment from the broadcast will everyone be talking about?

**Matty‚Äôs answer to get the juices flowing:** In a push to promote its messaging apps, Meta brings back the ‚ÄúWasssssup!‚Äù bit from Budweiser‚Äôs commercial but has people saying ‚ÄúWhatsApppppppp‚Äù to each other instead.
