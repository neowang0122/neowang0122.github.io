Layoffs slowed in June, and labor accumulation is still ongoing. Non-farmers may be “frightened” again tonight.

Employment in the US has once again surpassed expectations, and the deviation from the data is astonishing.

According to the latest “small non-farmers” ADP report released on Thursday, 497,000 new jobs were added in the US in June, more than double the market forecast of 225,000, far exceeding the previous value of 278,000, the biggest monthly increase since July 2022.

This data highlights the continued high fever in the labor market and fueled expectations of aggressive interest rate hikes. Overnight, the US stock market saw another “stock and debt double kill.”

Why did ADP exceed expectations? Why is it difficult for high interest rates to cool down employment? Will Fenong be surprised or frightened tonight?

## Why did ADP far exceed expectations?

The analysis points out that ADP may have far exceeded expectations by three points. The slowdown in layoffs in June and labor accumulation is still ongoing, or it is also possible that the previous slowdown in employment was the “episode.”

The number of layoffs dropped in January/June

Over the past few months, the US tech industry has set off a wave of large-scale layoffs, but now this trend is slowing down.

According to data released by recruitment company Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday morning, US employers announced 40,709 layoffs in June, the lowest monthly figure since October 2022.

Despite this, the total number of 458,209 layoffs announced in the first half of this year is still the highest figure from January to June since 2009\. Excluding 2020, when 89,6675 layoffs were announced, the technology industry continues to account for the vast majority of layoffs.

Andy Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement:

> The decline in the number of layoffs is not unusual in the summer. In fact, June is the slowest month in history to announce layoffs, and it is also possible that the deep unemployment predicted by inflation and interest rates will not occur, especially when the Federal Reserve suspends interest rate hikes.

2\. Is the rise in unemployment an “unexpected episode”?

The US unemployment rate surged in May, jumping from 3.4% to 3.7%. The sudden and sharp rise in unemployment was largely unexpected, especially in light of strong employment growth.

The monthly non-agricultural report consists of two surveys to measure employment levels and activity: one surveys the employment, working hours, and income of enterprises; the other surveys households to obtain the population's labor force status and demographic details. The unemployment rate comes from the latter and is generally considered unstable due to the small sample size.

Glassdoor's chief economist Aaron Terrazas stated in comments published last week:

> The unemployment rate is likely to rise to 3.9% in June as recent college graduates enter the job market and recently laid off workers slow to re-enter employment.

3\. Labor accumulation and soft landing

Recent job market data shows that, despite weak demand, more businesses are hoarding labor to maintain the number of employees. Part of the reason for this situation is the severe shortage of workers and broader demographic changes during the pandemic, such as Baby Boomers leaving the labor market.

Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, stated:

> Given this, we do think companies will be more reluctant to let workers leave, which helps the argument that the economy can achieve a soft landing and reduce inflation without losing a lot of jobs or triggering a recession.

Why did the most aggressive rate hike since the 1980s fail to reduce the inflation rate to the 2% target to cool the job market?

The answer is that high interest rates may not hit the pain point of inflation.Tomas Dvorak, an economist at the Oxford Institute of Economics, believes that the impact of interest rate hikes is only partially concentrated on the sector that drives basic inflation.

As we all know, interest rate makers can do little to cool down commodity prices, which have always been the main driver of inflation, leaving the Federal Reserve under-controlled economic activities affected by global pricing, such as agriculture and utilities.

In contrast, Dvorak's estimate shows that manufacturing bears the brunt of the impact of monetary policy. At the peak of the influence of monetary policy, for every 1 percentage point increase in interest rates, its output falls by 0.23%. However, employment in manufacturing has cooled down somewhat. However, in the service sector, such as the hotel industry, prices are rising even faster because the impact of interest rates is not obvious.

According to some economists, the big problem is that in the past 40 years, the Western economy's huge shift to the service sector has caused monetary policy to lose its impact. According to traditional theory, durable goods manufacturers such as automobile manufacturers can sense higher interest rates in particular through their motivation to hold large inventories.

The Federal Reserve has acknowledged that service sector inflation may take longer to be brought under control. As another explanation for sticky inflation, the Federal Reserve study suggests that it takes 18 to 24 months for policies to have an impact on the entire economy. But if this were true, the Fed should not use the latest inflation figures as a basis for decision-making. Hawkish officials recently said that the lag period has been shortened.

## Will non-farmers face another shock tonight?

There was a large-scale and unexpected peak in the recruitment activities of US companies in June, and the heavy non-farm payrolls report to be released tonight may also reflect the continued strength of the labor market.

The analysis predicts that non-farmers will almost certainly show that the US labor market has been increasing employment for 30 consecutive months.

Although current employment growth is dwarfed by the expansion of the labor market between 2010 and 2019, which had a record 100 months of employment growth at the time, the current continuous growth deviates from expectations. The higher-than-average growth occurred when inflation slowed and the Federal Reserve raised interest rates sharply.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of new jobs added so far this year is the tenth largest number since records began from January to May since 1939\. The average of 314,000 new jobs per month this year far exceeds the level before the pandemic.

Despite this, some economists believe that labor market growth will eventually slow; this is only a matter of time. Economists expect non-farmers to fall below this average in June, as well as the 339,000 jobs added in May.According to Reuters data, economists' general expectation is that 225,000 new jobs will be added, yet the predictions of the 82 economists that make up this consensus vary greatly, ranging from 110,000 to 288,000 jobs; the unemployment rate is expected to drop from 3.7% to 3.6%, with expectations ranging from 3.4% to 3.8%.
