**Good morning.** We’ve all been there—you work tirelessly on a project only to have it spiked at the last minute by your boss.

But the plight of Richard Plaud might be on another level. The Frenchman spent _eight years_ creating a 23.6-foot model Eiffel Tower out of 700,000+ matchsticks to set the record for tallest matchstick sculpture. But last week, Guinness Book of World Records [disqualified it](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h13?mblid=9ec719682167&mbcid=34273549.3465864&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) because the matchsticks he used weren’t commercially available. Guinness acknowledged its decision may have been “heavy-handed” and will review the judgment.

Still, Plaud threw shade at London-based Guinness, writing, “Clearly, the English are really different......![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/18x0,sCFHK7u0BhWveJ5RGjfRJlr7mUfH0oQTCuRcoZQLWzMs/https://em-content.zobj.net/thumbs/120/apple/237/face-with-look-of-triumph_1f624.png).” Which is exactly what we thought when they first created a book of people with long fingernails.

## [ US buys more from Mexico than China ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h15?mbcid=34273549.3465864&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)

If sending stuff to America were an Olympic sport, Mexico would be biting a gold medal before thanking geopolitics and market forces. The country [surpassed China](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h16?mblid=17d610b45681&mbcid=34273549.3465864&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) as the top exporter to the US last year for the first time in 20 years, according to data the Census Bureau shared yesterday.

It's as much a China flop as a Mexico triumph: The US-China trade deficit (aka the difference between imports and exports) shrank to the lowest level last year since 2010\. While that might be partially due to the US pulling back on its post-pandemic shopping spree, [according](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h18?mblid=641ba36fbf4e&mbcid=34273549.3465864&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to the WSJ, the trend signifies China losing its status as America’s go-to trade partner.

Here’s why it’s happening…

* Trump-era tariffs on select products, and the Biden administration’s climate rules aimed at limiting dependence on clean tech from China, have made the country’s imports pricier. (A group of economists [showed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h17?mblid=f9c4636dcce0&mbcid=34273549.3465864&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) that US imports of many Chinese goods unaffected by tariffs kept growing after the trade war began in 2018.)
* US-China political beef further convinced some manufacturers serving the American market to set up shop south of the border instead, Jesús Carmona, Mexico and Central America president at Schneider Electric, told NYT.
* Hiring workers in China became more expensive as the country got richer.

## Goodbye China?

Foreign investment in Mexico rose 21% last year, partially due to exporters ditching China. Other countries are also vying to become America’s factory: The share of US imports coming from South Korea and India grew over the past year.

**But…**China still plays a major role in making the products that get shipped to US shores. Even for US imports made elsewhere, Chinese companies often supply the components, and they’ve been [pouring](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h19?mblid=e7cdc3dd8272&mbcid=34273549.3465864&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) billions into manufacturing facilities in Mexico as a way to sidestep the US’s punishing tariffs.

**Looking ahead…**US-China trade might get squeezed even more. Donald Trump recently said he’s considering a 60% tariff on Chinese goods if he’s elected president again._—SK_

* While some ads will air on both CBS and Nick, 15 advertisers opted for a Nickelodeon-only package.
* Most ads on the main Super Bowl broadcast this year went for an average of $7 million. But Nickelodeon sold its spots for just $200k–$300k, making Big Game ads accessible to a new class of advertisers.

The courts don’t care who makes the best butter chicken, just who made it first. That’s because Moti Mahal, a legendary staple of Delhi cuisine, [sued](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h1p?mblid=857ae3e3e2b6&mbcid=34273549.3465864&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) rival restaurant chain Daryaganj, hoping to put an end to its claim of inventing butter chicken.

In a 2,752-page lawsuit that will be heard by the Delhi High Court in May and that has captured India’s attention, Moti Mahal says it wants $240,000 and bragging rights for creating the iconic dish.

## **Two origin stories**

Moti Mahal is run by the family of Kundan Lal Gujral, who claim Gujral created butter chicken \~80 years ago by adding leftover tandoori chicken to a tomato gravy at the end of the night so the chicken pieces didn’t dry out.

Meanwhile, Daryaganj claims the dish wasn’t created until Gujral met _their_ family’s patriarch and his soon-to-be chef, Kundan Lal Jaggi. Their story is that Jaggi invented the dish by using the buttery sauce to stretch a few pieces of tandoori chicken for a large group of diners. 

**Or maybe three…**another restaurant just entered the game of chicken. A different family who bought the original Moti Mahal restaurant in the ’90s say _they_ invented butter chicken and might consider heading to court as well._—MM_

### GRAB BAG

**Stat:** Young Americans have been securing the bag since the pandemic, largely thanks to their portfolios popping off. The [combined wealth](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h1t?mblid=4fb6cf0d96ea&mbcid=34273549.3465864&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of adults under forty has shot up 80% since 2019, compared to 10% for people 40–54 and 30% for the over-55 set, according to economists at the New York Fed. That’s in part because they were poorer than their elders to start with, so they got more Covid stimulus cash that they put into stocks, which have since had a good run. But money from stocks leaves young people exposed to a volatile asset, since the market…doesn’t always go up.

**Quote:** “There aren’t many things that haven’t been done with a chicken nugget. This was definitely one of them.”

The nugget innovation that so excited an employee tasked with making a marketing splash for the 50th anniversary of a UK supermarket was sending the processed meat [up to space](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/h1u?mblid=f1f7c6c6134a&mbcid=34273549.3465864&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). Kinda—he worked with Sent Into Space, a company that specializes in getting objects into “near space,” \~20 miles above the earth’s surface, and photographing them with the planet below. And he’s not the only marketer boldly going where no product has gone before, according to the Wall Street Journal: A Stanley Quencher was shipped up for the TikTok fave’s European debut—and sold out 24 hours later.
