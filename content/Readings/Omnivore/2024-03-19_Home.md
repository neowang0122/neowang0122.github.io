## Obsidian’s plugin

1. Install the plugins through Obsidian Community or [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)
2. Configure the plugin options:
* Repo name
* Your GitHub username
* The GitHub token (available [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo))
* The share key
1. Add the sharing key as `true` in Obsidian’s note frontmatter
2. Customize (or not) the folder options
3. Run the commands through the file menu or commands palette.

> If you use your vault directly in a repository, the upload will corrupt your files! This module is not intended for this type of workflow.
