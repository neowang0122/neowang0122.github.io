**Good morning.** It’s Saturday, so there’s a little more time for breakfast and a little more time to start an argument in your group chat.

Here’s a prompt that combines the two. Rank the following doughy breakfast items in order of delectability: french toast, waffles, crepes, and pancakes.

The best part about this question is there’s no right answer…just wrong answers.

[ ![Tupperware’s stock is rebounding](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,sO3HSBiQe7YQcAR821TWTzx745VwddTcAXDxPwwdZHMQ/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/672793f58a0d11bc0326dc5f02e00c72d6fcac72-1500x1000.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/al7?mbcid=32304874.3804616&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) _Francis Scialabba_ 

It’s raining Tupperware on the New York Stock Exchange like someone just flung open the kitchen cabinets.

The plastic container brand revealed back in April that it was on the verge of bankruptcy, but the stock still smelled fresh to day traders who sniff out the market’s leftovers. And the traders’ strategy is starting to look more airtight after shares reached a nine-month high yesterday following Tupperware’s announcement of a deal with lenders to restructure its debt and secure $21 million in new financing.

## How Tupperware’s value got preserved

After a pandemic-era boom in sales ended, the 77-year-old enabler of we-have-food-at-home families [stumbled](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/al8?mblid=80ee4320b57f&mbcid=32304874.3804616&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), and Tupperware Brands was warned in June that the NYSE might delist it because of its low value and sub-$1 stock price.

But last month, penny stock savants started snapping up the company’s shares, BlackRock [stepped in](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/al9?mblid=fcf3328faede&mbcid=32304874.3804616&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) as an investment partner. Tupperware’s stock has since soared to around $5—still low, but offering meteoric returns for people who bought in last month at its 61-cent nadir.

**But Tupperware might be more than a meme stock.** Some analysts [say](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ala?mblid=e6f842eef522&mbcid=32304874.3804616&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the container company’s rebound looks less like the internet-fueled spike in AMC’s and GameStop’s stocks, and more like another risky recent phenomenon: a bankrupt stock buy-up.

Notable examples include…

* Transportation company Yellow Corp.: It shut down operations last weekend…and then saw its stock soar by roughly 350% between Monday and Friday amid reports it was working to secure a loan through bankruptcy.
* Hertz: The rental car company enjoyed a 900% stock rally in the two weeks following its 2020 bankruptcy filing. It emerged from bankruptcy with an unusual deal that paid off its debts _and_ paid out to stockholders.

**Looking ahead...**for Tupperware to mount a full comeback, it would have to confront the reason its stock (and its sales) started sliding in the first place: increased competition from brands like Pyrex and Rubbermaid._—ML_

The cycles that keep your body running can sometimes get out of whack.

Random sugar cravings and afternoon crashes are just two ways your metabolism can affect your bod. Fortunately, there’s [Metabolic Daily from Pendulum](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/ak%5F?lp=text1&mbadid=89de5275182726b8f4644d7b89d57f3e&mbadv=a&mblid=6d0e1bdb9726&mbcid=32304874.3804616&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

Sage Therapeutics and Biogen plan to start selling the pill in the US under the brand name Zurzuvae by the end of the year, after the Drug Enforcement Administration completes its review. Sage already has a postpartum depression treatment on the market, but it’s an infusion given continuously over two days, making it much less convenient for parents wrangling newborns than the new pill, which should be taken daily for two weeks.

Yesterday, feeling the heat from Hindenburg’s claims, Icahn’s firm [announced](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alK?mblid=49cd234c1585&mbcid=32304874.3804616&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) it would halve its quarterly dividend and refocus on the kind of investing that made him famous.

A trial on the remaining claims in the high-profile case is scheduled to begin on September 12\. The government hasn’t had much luck enforcing antitrust claims against Big Tech recently, but the case still poses a potential threat to Google’s core business.

Bots are usually the last thing you want to encounter on a dating app while swiping through endless photos of people standing atop mountains, but Tinder is preparing to harness the [power of AI](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alf?mblid=445c83de380d&mbcid=32304874.3804616&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for the good of your profile.

The app, which already uses artificial intelligence in its matching algorithms, has started testing new customer-facing tools. One sifts through your photos and selects the best five to display (hopefully with the good sense to avoid the ambiguous group shot), addressing a pain point where many users get flustered when building their profile.

**It’s just the beginning of the AI dating revolution.** Tinder’s parent company, Match Group, which also owns Hinge and OKCupid, revealed plans in its recent earnings announcement to integrate new AI features across its brands—not just to help build profiles but also to highlight why someone may be a good match.

And the company can’t control whether daters bring AI into the mix themselves: A recent UK study found that over 50% of single men would use chatbots to help chat up potential dates.

**Lo-fi alternatives:** As dating apps go increasingly high-tech, some singles are turning to more staid [Google Docs](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/alg?mblid=b91e7c64be72&mbcid=32304874.3804616&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) and creating long-form “date-me docs” to find romance outside the app grind.—_AR_

## Open House

Welcome to Open House, the only newsletter section that believes it’s what’s on the inside that counts. We’ll give you a few facts about a listing and you try to guess the price.

![Chicago home with a lot of black and white patterned carpet and mirrored designs.](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,s-N4Ld4q751p2qJvevQ7bhpjgcUtpXUDnzy4Unyyj4Qk/https://storage.morningbrew.com/gif/2023-08-04/image-aed8fb923ed27b8ee74467e0085c96f40924a36b-1200x798-gif/logan.gif)_Zillow_

But once inside, you are transported into what can only be described as a 2010 prom dress store in a Midwestern mall. The 1,542-square-foot home has so many mirrored accents you’ll never escape your flaws. Amenities include:

* 2 beds, 2 baths
* Entrance chandelier
* “Finished” basement with loose stove

How much for the shiny Logan Square living space?
