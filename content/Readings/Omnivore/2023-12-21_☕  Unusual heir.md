The last time this many Nordic people were battling one common enemy, they were wearing Gjermundbu helmets. Since October, Swedish workers and labor groups from neighboring countries have joined a [growing strike](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fCm?mblid=c5167a4b4699&mbcid=33764775.3570148&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) against billionaire Elon Musk’s EV company, Tesla.

**It all started on October 27,** when about 130 mechanics walked off their jobs at 10 garages in Sweden after Tesla said it wouldn’t sign a collective bargaining agreement with the powerful Swedish union IF Metall. Musk is staunchly anti-organized labor, but almost 90% of workers in Sweden are covered by collective agreements.

Since the initial walk-off, several other Swedish unions have joined in solidarity strikes:

* One of Tesla’s Swedish vendors, Hydro Extrusions, said its workers will not make a component for the company.
* Unions representing workers who paint the cars, clean Tesla’s offices, and service 70 charging stations in the country have also dropped their paint brushes, vacuums, and…um, electric tester things… in solidarity.
* Postal workers stopped delivering license plates to Tesla. The company sued so it could bypass the mail and pick up the plates and registration numbers on its own. The lawsuit is still floating around the Swedish legal system, but an appeals court judge told Tesla “no <3” and more unions got mad that Musk was trying to go above their heads.
* Even the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union said it will cease picking up trash at all of the company’s workspaces in the country starting Sunday.

**Also…**dockworkers in Denmark aren’t unloading Teslas, and unions in Finland and Norway are preparing to stop business associated with the company if it doesn’t sign an agreement soon. Plus, 16 regional investors have written strongly worded letters to Tesla’s board, and PensionDanmark and Denmark’s teacher pension fund dumped a combined $100 million in Tesla stock. Tesla hasn’t responded publicly, but is [hiring](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fCn?mblid=1ac69d3fadf2&mbcid=33764775.3570148&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) a “Nordics public policy” expert. 

**Looking ahead…**this won’t be the last organized labor woe that Musk has to deal with. The United Auto Workers [said](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fCo?mblid=76c325af940e&mbcid=33764775.3570148&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) last month it has plans to organize Tesla and other nonunionized carmakers across the US._—MM_

Just last month, an iconic Picasso painting shattered expectations when it sold for a whopping $139m at auction. Impressive, considering it was purchased for _around $1m_ in the late 1960s.

But there’s a surprising group of investors also celebrating this sale: 61k everyday users of [one investment platform](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fuF?lp=text1&mbadid=ac646fde8fa3351bb3b588db8d1fc7b6&mbadv=a&mblid=1071f5df64e6&mbcid=33764775.3570148&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

Why? Because that platform, Masterworks, enables anyone to invest in blue-chip paintings by artists like [Picasso and Banksy](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fuF?lp=text2&mbadid=ac646fde8fa3351bb3b588db8d1fc7b6&mbadv=a&mblid=d87c538cecb9&mbcid=33764775.3570148&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for just a fraction of the cost. When Masterworks sells a painting, investors can get a return.

This way, not only the billionaires of the world can benefit from the art market.

Bird said its Canadian and European units are not part of the bankruptcy and will operate normally.

The third-largest drugstore chain in America got in some hot water this week with federal regulators who claim Rite Aid never told customers that it was using facial recognition software on them while they bought batteries and Alka-Seltzer—or that the AI system was falsely flagging people as wrongdoers.

Rite Aid [agreed](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fCx?mblid=25587f8c2bdc&mbcid=33764775.3570148&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) yesterday not to use this technology for five years after the Federal Trade Commission accused the company of causing “emotional and reputational harm” to customers at some stores between 2012 and 2020\. According to the [FTC](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fCy?mblid=bbd58c606fd9&mbcid=33764775.3570148&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a), Rite Aid’s facial recognition system…

* Incorrectly identified innocent customers as shoplifters thousands of times and, in one instance, prompted a search of an 11-year-old girl.
* Generated 900+ match alerts to one person’s picture in its database in 130 stores during a five-day period.
* Was mostly used in areas with large Black, Latino, and Asian communities, where it was also more likely to return false-positive matches.

Despite accepting the ban, Rite Aid said it disagrees with the FTC’s accusations and already stopped using the tech more than three years ago.

Nicolas Puech, a billionaire descendant of the founder of French luxury designer Hermès, is seeking to change the fate of his fortune by [adopting](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fCG?mblid=5c852289f96d&mbcid=33764775.3570148&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) his 51-year-old former gardener. The green-thumbed gentleman, if adopted, would stand to inherit at least half of Puech’s estimated $13 billion estate.

**It’s a big if.** Adult adoption laws in Switzerland, where they live, are strict and have complex requirements. Adoption aside, Puech’s plan faces legal obstacles from his own charity, the Isocrates Foundation, with which he has an inheritance contract. If Puech, who is not known to have children, were to suddenly adopt an heir, at least 50% of his Hermès shares would go to a son instead of the foundation, which called the potential move “void and unfounded.”

**As for the why…**many speculate that the [unusual](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fCH?mblid=58b4618091aa&mbcid=33764775.3570148&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) succession plan could have something to do with a yearslong corporate [feud](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fCI?mblid=e9c8dfa8a2c4&mbcid=33764775.3570148&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) between Hermès and luxury conglomerate LVMH: According to Bloomberg, Puech became a family outcast for his role in the fight, which led to his leaving the board of Hermès and supposedly falling out with the rest of the fam.

**Stat:** Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea have forced over $80 billion in cargo to be [diverted](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fCM?mblid=09ce0e4668b8&mbcid=33764775.3570148&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) and caused an oil price spike that pushed gas prices toward their biggest [jump](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fCN?mblid=1975c415b36f&mbcid=33764775.3570148&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) since August. But there’s a group the shipping route snarl has been good for: the [shareholders](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fCO?mblid=512c7b121ebb&mbcid=33764775.3570148&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of shipping companies. Bloomberg calculated that, as of yesterday, the combined value of the 47 largest shipping companies had risen by $22 billion since December 12, when the attacks became more prominent.

So, the family that created it racked up credit card debt, sold a house, and cashed in 401(k)s to fund the first 5,000 copies of the book and the dolls that report to Santa that went with them, Co-CEO Christa Pitts told Bloomberg. Their intuition that selling North Pole narcs would pay off was good: They’ve sold 21 million elf dolls globally, and their holiday empire is estimated to be worth at least $100 million, per Bloomberg.
