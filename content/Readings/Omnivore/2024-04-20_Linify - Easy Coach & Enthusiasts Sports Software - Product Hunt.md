[@ivanoff](https://www.producthunt.com/@ivanoff) Wow, this is so complex. When I used to train, we had a very basic system and even the UI wasn't any better. Do you have any competition?

[@busmark\_w\_nika](https://www.producthunt.com/@busmark%5Fw%5Fnika) Thanks for your question! I think one of the biggest competitors is Mindbody, but they focus on big clubs and gyms! We wanted to make it more accessible to smaller teams!

[@busmark\_w\_nika](https://www.producthunt.com/@busmark%5Fw%5Fnika) We're exploring how we can offer the greatest benefit to the market. I live in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. I've observed that many clubs here rely on basic Google spreadsheets, which leads to challenges due to a lack of organized processes.
