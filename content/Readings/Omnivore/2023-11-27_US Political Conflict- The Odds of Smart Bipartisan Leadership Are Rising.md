# Full Content: 

As you know, I think that five big interrelated issues will be the main drivers of the future. They are:

1. Debt and the value of money
2. Domestic conflicts over wealth and values differences (particularly politically)
3. International conflicts (particularly geopolitically)
4. Acts of nature (particularly the costs of climate change)
5. Technology changes (particularly AI)

I believe that how these issues transpire will have enormous impacts on our well-being. 

Regarding the international geopolitical issue, as you know, about two weeks ago [we saw a stepping back from the brink](https://principles.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f817138263fa3d3dec4ad231d&id=5bfad5b6a8&e=bc6bf78208) in US-China relations which was good news. Regarding the domestic political issue, while a Trump-Biden race (which would be very bad) is still the most likely scenario that almost nobody wants, there is an emerging possibility that we won't see that and could see a return to bipartisan leadership, which would be great news. In my latest article, I described what that good news scenario looks like.
