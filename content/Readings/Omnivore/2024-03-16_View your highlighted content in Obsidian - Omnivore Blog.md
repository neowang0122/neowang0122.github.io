### Create your highlights in Omnivore, view them in Obsidian

We just released an update to our [Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/omnivore-app/obsidian-omnivore) (v1.3.0) that allows you to view your highlighted content inline in Obsidian.

If you are already using Omnivore and Obsidian together, you can sync the full content of articles saved to Omnivore into Obsidian by adding `{{{ content }}}` to your custom template in the plugin settings.

The content variable inserts the readable content of the article, as Markdown. Any highlights that you have created in Omnivore will be rendered as Markdown highlights.

If you are an Obsidian user that hasnâ€™t heard of Omnivore: we are a free and open-source read-it-later app. You can save PDFs and Web articles to Omnivore, read them distraction free, add notes and highlights, and then sync all of that into Obsidian.
