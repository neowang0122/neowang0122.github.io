**Good morning.** In today’s special edition newsletter, we’re going to give your eyes a break from reading and bring you the images that defined 2023, from the picket lines of Hot Strike Summer to a swagged-out, algorithmically generated supreme pontiff.

Here are the images of the year.

## [ Hot Strike Summer…and fall ](#) 

![SAG on strike](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,sqZoAdUVd2ft9vHN3-lKmZ4lMcx9-879VNnH_0VkU7ds/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/cbd6a2c1be95b338d255eabab5e12570f4f2998a-5568x3712.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) _Valerie Macon/Getty Images_ 

It’s possible that 2023 will be remembered as the year the US labor movement got its [groove back](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/e3f?mblid=d508e69b0034&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). Hot Strike Summer saw Hollywood’s writers and actors walk off the job, marking the first time that the WGA and SAG-AFTRA were on strike together since 1960\. Both strikes concluded after tense negotiations regarding streaming residuals and the use of AI. UPS workers won major concessions just for _threatening_ an economy-crushing strike, and UAW members wielded a chaotic new picketing strategy in their historic action against Detroit’s Big Three automakers that helped them score big raises.

### PRESENTED BY AT&T

## [ **Take the scenic route(r)** ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9sD?lp=title&mbadid=d471f1669c743ad8db6ece8b337e7fcb&mbadv=a&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)

Planning a road trip in the new year? Closing out some holiday errands? Picking up hot cocoa ingredients? Whatever’s on your agenda, make the most out of your time behind the wheel with AT&T’s [unlimited In-car Wi-Fi plan](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9sD?lp=text1&mbadid=d471f1669c743ad8db6ece8b337e7fcb&mbadv=a&mblid=59f4dbc870eb&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).  

AT&T In-car Wi-Fi allows you to stream video for the kiddos in the back seat, play your favorite tunes, and stay seamlessly connected, no matter where the road takes you.  

Sound ideal? AT&T is offering [4 days of free In-car Wi-Fi](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9sD?lp=text2&mbadid=d471f1669c743ad8db6ece8b337e7fcb&mbadv=a&mblid=45769d6a1046&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) so you can test-drive this potential.

Whether it’s long drives or short trips, you can [take connectivity for a spin](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9sD?lp=text3&mbadid=d471f1669c743ad8db6ece8b337e7fcb&mbadv=a&mblid=9f181aff3723&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

## [ The first ever ex-presidential mug shot ](#) 

![Mugshot of Donald Trump](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,snCV3Z1RdcwZfD6WlgpEdVUs6Mf02DsksAhNeiWXRY5s/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/902bee1fe48c5296dc950585255eb9c4b1e03abc-1500x1000.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) _Fulton County Sheriff’s Office_ 

The [criminal cases](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/fqy?mblid=47d7283805ef&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) pending against former President Donald Trump are polarizing: His critics say they demonstrate that he’s not fit to hold office, while supporters see them as attempts to hurt him politically. But when Georgia authorities [released](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/b6t?mblid=d76b8eb25bcb&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) his mug shot, both sides were united in viewing the image as an opportunity to make some cash. It got featured in fundraising appeals and slapped on merch almost instantly.

## [ A House divided ](#) 

![U.S. Rep.-elect Katie Porter (D-CA) reads a book in the House Chamber during the fourth day of elections for Speaker of the House.](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,s_y5Af3lIPvKDxH7T16i31pjTw7nCHyoLwsqF91XvIgs/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/3355ffb6cb565b43998ce88c743b6c3dd78208e1-1024x669.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) _Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images_ 

Congress did not have its House in order this year. It kicked off the session with a painful 15-round vote in which Rep. Kevin McCarthy finally claimed the Speaker of the House job—only to find himself the first-ever lawmaker ousted from the role nine months later when his right-wing colleagues objected to his decision to work with Democrats to keep the government funded. Now, McCarthy is leaving Congress, and so are a [record number](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/eA0?mblid=abbb878be6fc&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of other lawmakers fed up with the drama. And speaking of drama, [George Santos](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/egk?mblid=ec8f07dd50cf&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) was also expelled from Congress.

## [ The Israel–Hamas war ](#) 

![Signs with hostages](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,s5H70lcsNA_HsVmoPCuKD-6Pcls_Y7E3lePafQJwYbn4/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/7430173d4266977814e2fd6f6de2dee4fe1231b5-5253x3499.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) _Leon Neal/Getty Images_ 

Hamas’s surprise October 7 attack on Israel immediately reshaped global politics. The assault on southern Israeli towns and an outdoor music festival left 1,200 dead, according to Israel’s estimates. It was described by many as “Israel’s 9/11” and [prompted](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/cQb?mblid=13c0791279fe&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) the Israeli government to go to war with the goal of eradicating Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007\. Hamas also captured about 240 hostages, including children, elderly people, and citizens of other nations, such as the US and Thailand. Some hostages have been released in exchange for temporary cease-fires or through other deals.

## [ Devastation in Gaza ](#) 

![A view after Israeli airstrikes on Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,skVXGcRzDD34dC1U39QtOU1rc7_jUhRzvf6P2Qn3mvfM/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/2ef43d450fc0844de369da71251dc89d7bf12f74-1500x1000.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) _Anadolu Agency/Getty Images_ 

Israel’s [war](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/dzR?mblid=9bb28ec061b0&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) on Hamas has involved an intense bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip, a small and densely populated area. More than 20,000 people have been killed, including many women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. In addition to being responsible for the large death toll, the combat has created a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, leaving the Palestinian territory without adequate food, clean water, fuel, and medical care. Despite facing international pressure for a broad cease-fire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the offensive.

## [ Wild weather ](#) 

![Snowy mountains fill the landscape behind the Hollywood sign.](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,s6smpNwlL445qY0oGVMuqgE3SecYHu-O-lR5dytvWDS8/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/cfa97524e6b96e4a323fa73cb2a35d6444b06966-1500x1000.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) _Patrick T. Fallon / Getty Images_ 

It was a year of extreme weather, whether that meant historic [snowfall](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/74R?mblid=9ec9334c8f1b&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in California that finally pulled the state out of a drought or a scorching [summer](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9WI?mblid=5739fa51380a&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) around the globe that clocked in as the hottest ever.

### TOGETHER WITH THE POINTS GUY

[ ![The Points Guy](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,sdkUAV_1LpcXV91nvBqeY_6FgcwekuFJ_k3MhSwUDj7c/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/ab8cf1a31ef72c5977adc383ee511e7631795de6-1800x1080.png?w=668&q=90&auto=format) ](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/eJU?lp=image&mbadid=b57b350e2d1d6d00955f6bc2edf92b6d&mbadv=a&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) 

**Don’t tread on my points.** Did you cash in credit card points for holiday travel? If the Credit Card Competition Act of 2023 becomes law, that option could go away. The proposed legislation might affect how credit card companies structure their loyalty programs. Wanna speak out? [The Points Guy can help](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/eJU?lp=text1&mbadid=b57b350e2d1d6d00955f6bc2edf92b6d&mbadv=a&mblid=bd65e2da3dde&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

## [ The Drippy Pope ](#) 

![The pope in a stylish coat](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,sPDvIqgJNIgEQxuU-hoa3Q0umxUn0Gu2YdtsiTBs5VOk/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/cf8f4086787880a8ff3fdb941f7312cf36b83951-1146x720.png?w=668&q=70&auto=format) _Midjourney/Reddit_ 

One of the most iconic images of 2023 wasn’t even real. The so-called [Drippy Pope](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/4BY?mblid=d2b1e8b1ae33&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) pics, showing Pope Francis stepping out in a Balenciaga puffer that he never actually wore, turned out to be cooked up using AI image generator Midjourney by a Chicago man (who claimed to be high on magic mushrooms at the time). The viral image sparked anxiety over the possibility of deepfakes spreading misinformation about issues more consequential than the pontiff’s fashion sense.

## [ The search for the Titan ](#) 

![OceanGate Titan submersible underwater](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,sN1kbfczLI1sgj_Ehy5qNjdnzJ_6XNb9E448dGWoWJHw/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/21863eb9e3ad8c32e8881dc21af86ef698a82a2b-800x550.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) _OceanGate/Handout/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images_ 

For one week in June, the whole world was captivated by the fate of the OceanGate Titan submersible, which went missing during an expensive voyage to the wreckage of the Titanic. Unfortunately, the outcome was a sad one, as [the search](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/8zc?mblid=814452573a4e&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for the sub ended with confirmation that all five passengers—including OceanGate’s CEO, who had been warned about safety concerns—had died in an implosion.

## [ Barbenheimer took over the internet (and cinemas) ](#) 

![A fan-made Barbenhimer poster](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,sNzERwsA5jWn6HnbTGUcA-W3fu9ofqzDDMcIj_Ka-e2Q/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/d474d1d4cf1530886aca8721a5b12cae053d70c8-1154x1448.png?w=668&q=70&auto=format) _Sean Longmore via Instagram_ 

What do a surprisingly clever feminist pink confection of a film created to sell dolls and a three-hour epic about the making of the atomic bomb have in common? Not much. But they had the same premiere date, and that was enough for the internet to embrace, turning a double feature of the two into a [major phenomenon](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/9AI?mblid=b3f225d6d91b&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) known as Barbenheimer. And it wasn’t just the custom-made Etsy merch that made money: With the hype boosting both films, _Barbie_ became the first movie with a solo female director to make $1 billion, and _Oppenheimer_ grossed more than any WWII movie ever had.

## [ A whole lot of volleyball fans ](#) 

![The crowd at Nebraska Volley Ball Day](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,sLx36c8jSZFSoJQow6xFfRHY2dW39jZ0Q7zj4P--GffI/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/9dd8383f078b5bad3c36ca7a95cbfc0f6bdcd896-4096x2731.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) _University of Nebraska Athletic Department via X_ 

Lionel Messi’s move to the US may have been the biggest news in sports this year, but Barbie wasn’t the only cultural event to prove people will come out to watch women perform: 92,003 fans filled the University of Nebraska’s stadium to watch the Cornhuskers women’s volleyball team win, setting the [world record](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/bly?mblid=acd1eee2246a&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) for attendance at a women’s sports event. That’s more people than the stadium was built to hold for football games, so spectators were also seated on the field.

## [ Quite a performance ](#) 

![Taylor Swift performing in front of screen of herself during Eras tour.](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/670x0,sZX9x64JSfsHJ2FEMfXO5kvKku5vBFJmy5JUrVxaZ0yY/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/c0af1302adaebf83b97df7b307bd3a415329cba5-6000x4000.jpg?w=668&q=70&auto=format) _Kevin Winter/TAS Rights Management via Getty Images_ 

Did you really think we’d make it through a 2023 list without mentioning Taylor Swift? Though the pop star may see herself as the antihero, she had a lot of people rooting for her. Swift’s list of [accomplishments](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/eWg?mblid=251176380517&mbcid=33769462.4062051&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) this year includes her Eras Tour becoming the first concert tour ever to gross over $1 billion, releasing a concert film that helped keep movie theaters in business, becoming a billionaire, being named Time magazine’s Person of the Year—oh, and getting credited by the Fed for boosting the economy.
