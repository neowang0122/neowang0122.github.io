Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis launched his presidential campaign last May with a glitch-riddled announcement on Twitter.

On Sunday, he [ended](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gnG?mblid=b7b7e2d7acfb&mbcid=34073951.4006453&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) his campaign with a video on the same platform, endorsing front-runner Donald Trump for the presidency. DeSantis, who rose to prominence attacking Disney and fighting other “woke” institutions in his state, had high hopes but couldn’t muster enough support nationally to challenge Trump, who crushed him by 30 percentage points in the Iowa caucuses last week.

## A unique campaign strategy gone wrong

Among the strategic errors of DeSantis’s presidential bid was an [experiment](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gnH?mblid=10053f1ab895&mbcid=34073951.4006453&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) to outsource most of his campaign’s traditional functions to a super PAC called Never Back Down.

* Super PACs, short for political action committees, can raise unlimited money from individuals or corporations for campaigns, provided they don’t directly coordinate with the campaign.
* They emerged following the loosening of campaign finance laws in the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision.

Receiving the keys to a presidential campaign in a way no super PAC had before, Never Back Down amassed $269 million to throw behind their guy. However, it could not deploy that capital effectively due to mismanagement and ended up being sapped of cash.

* In the campaign’s early days, Never Back Down overhired staff and had to fire 40% of its initial employees within the first two months.
* Its chief strategist stepped down amid controversy in December, and the group’s next leader was [spotted](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gnI?mblid=39bbdedd7c64&mbcid=34073951.4006453&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) by staffers spending hours working on a jigsaw puzzle the week before the crucial Iowa caucuses.

The campaign also lost a major funding source when billionaire Ken Griffin, who had contributed millions to DeSantis’s past gubernatorial campaigns in Florida, stopped backing him over his focus on the culture war.

**Big picture:** While even a well-oiled DeSantis operation may not have toppled Trump, his reliance on a super PAC to run his campaign will likely [dissuade](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gnH?mblid=eced1d973cc5&mbcid=34073951.4006453&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) future candidates from trying the same strategy, the Washington Post reports.—_NF_

The building, located in the northern Indian city of Ayodhya, sits on the former site of Babri Masjid, a 16th-century mosque that was destroyed by Hindu nationalist mobs in 1992\. Modi, a member of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is running for a third consecutive term in the spring and is hoping the temple bolsters support with voters. But the opposition party called the event an “electoral stunt” that further damages India’s claim of religious tolerance.

Here’s a story about mean girls that not even Tina Fey could make up.

TikTok influencers are angrily calling out “Sephora Kids”: tweens who are spending big money at the beauty chain and also allegedly wreaking havoc at the stores. One Sephora employee [described](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gnT?mblid=e68f37f10d4d&mbcid=34073951.4006453&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) a 10-year-old fighting with her mom over a $900 purchase; a TikToker went viral [telling a story](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gnU?mblid=c47f9fb3f40b&mbcid=34073951.4006453&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) of how a tween “ate her up” after nabbing the last Drunk Elephant bronzing drops in the store, while other TikTokers posted examples of [destroyed sample stations](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gnV?mblid=f63bd41dc6cb&mbcid=34073951.4006453&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a).

**Is social media to blame?** With any modern problem, older generations tend to shake their fists at the cloud that is social media for creating viral firestorms—and there may be some truth to it.

A crush of influencer marketing and the “bandwagon effect,” a heightened desire to fit in with your peers, has Gen Alpha coveting the expensive items they see in the popular “[get ready with me](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gnW?mblid=d79dbe6d2a9e&mbcid=34073951.4006453&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a)” videos, and they’ve developed into a cohort with immense purchasing power (despite not having any income). Historically inexpensive products are now increasing in price thanks to demand among the 10–13 set.

**What about parents?** A [Gallup](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gnX?mblid=7203b0be326f&mbcid=34073951.4006453&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) poll conducted last summer shows more than half of teens spend at least four hours per day on social media, leaving them susceptible to what some may consider predatory marketing. Outside of throwing your child’s devices into a lake, there really isn’t a playbook yet for handling this type of pervasive advertising._—DL_

With her 1,203rd career victory on Sunday, Stanford’s Tara VanDerveer passed Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski to become the [winningest basketball coach](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/gog?mblid=c27f0dedecd9&mbcid=34073951.4006453&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) in NCAA history. In a recent [interview](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/goh?mblid=ba75acfef389&mbcid=34073951.4006453&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a) with the NYT, VanDerveer shared her rules for leading a winning team: “Hire right. As my dad said, ‘You can’t win the Kentucky Derby on a donkey.’ And not just players but staff. Be sure they complement you more than compliment you.”

**Quote:** “Nobody alive today will see it happen again.”

Entomologist Floyd W. Shockley wants to mentally prepare you for a historic—and loud—event this spring: two cicada groups [emerging simultaneously](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/go2?mblid=54ad72446f36&mbcid=34073951.4006453&mid=1f4660240f65a00f40c621ae6f9ce93a). The last time Brood XIX, which has a 13-year cycle, and Brood XIII, which has a 17-year cycle, emerged in the same year was in 1803, when Napoleon was presumably so fed up by their mating calls that he sold the Louisiana Territory to Thomas Jefferson. The cicadas’ bacchanal will begin in late April. Then they won’t appear together for another 221 years.
