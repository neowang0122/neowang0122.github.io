# Full Content: 

This article by Dr [Piotr Wozniak](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr%5FWozniak "Piotr Wozniak") is part of [SuperMemo Guru](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo%5FGuru "SuperMemo Guru") series on memory, learning, creativity, and problem solving. 

## Introduction

The way we formulate knowledge in learning has a monumental impact on memory. Well-phrased questions make learning easy. Well-structured knowledge will help keep it in memory for life.

**[Effective learning: 20 rules of knowledge formulation](http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm)**, compiled in 1999, describes the most important rules needed to effectively formulate good questions for long-term [retention](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retention "Retention"). Below I provide a concise executive summary (esp. for those interested in [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental%5Freading "Incremental reading")).

## Summary: 20 rules

* [don't learn things that you do not understand](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Do%5Fnot%5Fmemorize%5Fbefore%5Fyou%5Funderstand "Do not memorize before you understand")
* learn before you memorize
* start from basics before going into complexities
* [keep questions simple](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Simple%5Fquestions%5Fin%5Fspaced%5Frepetition "Simple questions in spaced repetition")
* pictures assist memory
* learn mnemonic techniques, e.g. peg lists
* avoid lists, sets and enumerations (they can be tackled with [cloze deletion](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze%5Fdeletion "Cloze deletion") as in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ktH-TceHx8))
* personalize and provide examples
* [cloze deletion](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze%5Fdeletion "Cloze deletion") is fast and has a great [mnemonic power](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Mnemonic%5Fanchor "Mnemonic anchor")
* use [redundancy](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Redundancy "Redundancy") (similar [items](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item "Item") asking similar questions from different angles)
* use [references](http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References)

## New rules: incremental reading

With the advent of [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental%5Freading "Incremental reading"), the rules have been modified, and re-prioritized.

Changes of formulation strategy in [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental%5Freading "Incremental reading"):

* building comprehension may be part of the learning process, and creating [cloze deletions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze%5Fdeletion "Cloze deletion") on poorly understood phrases is acceptable
* learning and memorization may occur in parallel (see: [video](https://youtu.be/XRuLV2%5FA3Ts))
* early in the learning process, [items](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item "Item") may be [complex](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Complexity "Complexity"). They [get simplified incrementally](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Simple%5Fquestions%5Fin%5Fspaced%5Frepetition "Simple questions in spaced repetition") depending on [knowledge priority](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Priority%5Fqueue "Priority queue"), and the available time
* multiple [cloze deletions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze%5Fdeletion "Cloze deletion") on different formulations of the same statement may often substitute for mnemonic techniques (see: [Knowledge darwinism](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge%5Fdarwinism "Knowledge darwinism"))
* lists, sets, and enumerations can be easily tackled with [cloze deletion](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze%5Fdeletion "Cloze deletion") (see: [video](https://youtu.be/AmpdWZEAX3Q))
* for personalization, add your own stories to texts that you learn. [Elaborate creatively](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental%5Fwriting "Incremental writing")

## Meta rule: Pleasure of learning

A simple and universal litmus test for a good formulation is [pleasure of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure%5Fof%5Flearning "Pleasure of learning"). Each time you see a drop in pleasure, come back to this text and see if you can find a rule violation that might be responsible for the decline in fun.

## Meta rule: Applicability

We should strive at maximum [applicability](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability "Applicability") of knowledge.

[Human intelligence](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Simple%5Fformula%5Ffor%5Fhigh%5Fintelligence "Simple formula for high intelligence") is based on knowledge, of which **[abstract knowledge](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract%5Fknowledge "Abstract knowledge")** plays a particularly important role. Abstract knowledge is based on rules, such as 2+2=4\. Such rules may be employed in multiple contexts and contribute to problem solving capacity. Rules are more useful than facts. For example, it is more useful to know that 2+2=4 (rule) than to know that a friends's phone number beings with _4_ (fact). Rules and formulas are more [applicable](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability "Applicability") than facts. For more details see: [Abstract knowledge](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract%5Fknowledge "Abstract knowledge") 

## Meta rule: Simplicity

In representing knowledge, we should always strive at formulating **[atomic memories](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Complexity "Complexity")** set in a good context of comprehension. If learning is enjoyable, [items](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item "Item") are probably formulated pretty well. The picture explains why simple memories are easier to [retain](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retention "Retention"):

Memory complexity: simple and complex memories

> _**Figure:** **[Memory complexity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory%5Fcomplexity "Memory complexity")** illustrates the importance of the [minimum information principle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Minimum%5Finformation%5Fprinciple "Minimum information principle"). When memorizing simple questions and answers, we can rely on a simple memory connection, and uniformly refresh that connection at review. Complex memories may have their concepts activated in an incomplete fashion, or in a different sequence that depends on the context. As a result, it is hard to produce a uniform increase in [memory stability](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory%5Fstability "Memory stability") at review. Complex items are difficult to remember. An example of a simple item may be a word pair, e.g._ apple = pomo _(Esperanto). While a complex net of connection may be needed to recognize an apple. The connection between_ apple _and_ pomo _is irreducible (i.e. maximally simplified)_
