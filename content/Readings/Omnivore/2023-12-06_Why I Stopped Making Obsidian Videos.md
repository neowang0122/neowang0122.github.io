> I began to realize that if I continued down this path, I would become more obsessed with flashy new plugins and adding needless complexity to Obsidian, rather than actually using it.

### The Fallacy of Niching down

Everyone that makes any type of content online has been told to pick a niche and **stick** to it.

When I started my YouTube journey, I didn't even think about it, I just made videos on Obsidian as I saw that there was a severe lack of content on it, and it was, and still is, my favorite piece of software I've ever had. 

But I wanted to try something new. ==Not because I no longer use Obsidian, I use it every single day, but because I saw myself starting to no longer enjoy== **==only==** ==making videos about it.== 

And quite frankly, ==I began to realize that if I continued down this path, I would become more obsessed with flashy new plugins and adding needless complexity to Obsidian, rather than actually using it.== 

This goes against the conventional YouTube advice of niching down as much as you can. But that advice usually revolves around a paid course on the topic you're talking about. I have no interest in doing that anyway, and I've been told multiple times that my obsidian playlist was more useful than the paid courses people took on it.

Still, the majority of my subscribers found me through my Obsidian content. So I knew a good amount wouldn't be interested in other types of content.

Of course, it's not like I would be making DIY or gardening videos. But I was still wary of trying something new. 

The initial views were significantly lower. But eventually, most of the new videos started to find their audience. And now, ==my== ==[Mac Apps video](https://substack.com/redirect/1ae15d9b-4159-4031-8278-e59cfc963ca0?j=eyJ1IjoiMnkycXRhIn0.nuzIT9a4BeQSNYg8gdQVbZ5ZSwrFjuJ7f2hzSpwFB-Y)== ==is the best performer I’ve had.==

==I love making videos and I hope to continue making them for many years, but I think it's super important to remain interested in what you’re doing. Even at the expense of lower views.== 

Since I only send these out once a month, happy holidays! :)

Had quite the rant at the end of this one, glad it was well received!
