I have been asked if the stock market is in a bubble, especially the "Magnificent 7." As you know, I like to convert my thinking into indicators (principles) that can be back-tested to make my bets. If you're interested in how I do it and what the picture now looks like, I just shared my thoughts in a new post on LinkedIn.

If you don't care to understand the reasoning behind my answers and just want the short answer as to whether 1) the stock market as a whole and 2) the "Magnificent 7” are in a bubble, the answer to both is no. As always, I'd appreciate any thoughts or feedback you have on my approach.
