### [](#what-im-trying-to-do-1)What I’m trying to do

Hi. How can I remove the requirement to press control for preview on hover (in the preview window)? There is a question already [here 16](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-can-i-configure-page-preview-do-not-require-ctrl-cmd-on-hover-in-preview-mode/18557) (topic is closed so I have to start a new one), where it says that I can turn it off but I feel like I am missing something. Here is how my settings look like. I don’t have the option to unclick that. I tried different theme as well with no ==luck.==

==Does the Page Preview plugin only adress the editor and not the preview window)==

==Where it says ‘Preview’ in your image, toggle that option off.== Or are you saying that the toggle is not working?

Okay, that does it. I tried turning the whole plugin off and as expected it turned the plugin off ![:smiley:](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,sxb1sOiBMk5grX3x7PGZBDWT7bSOREZst6FtH_b8PG6I/https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/smiley.png?v=10 ":smiley:") .

==I have to say that for me this labelling is really consufing. I wouldn’t expect to have to turn off “preview” to get “preview”. It would actually be nice if the sentence that was on top as a heading “Require Ctrl to trigger page preview on hover” actually replaces the text “Preview” where there is a checkmark. The heading could simply be “Page preview plugin”.==
