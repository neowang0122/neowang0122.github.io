As you know, I attended the COP28 meetings in Dubai—mostly because of my OceanX initiative. Because climate change was obviously the biggest conversation driver at the meetings, and because it is one of the big 5 forces that is changing the world order in big ways, I wanted to delve deeply into the subject. 

For reasons explained in the attached piece it appears to me that:

1. The costs of dealing with climate change will be huge (5% of world GDP)
2. A more practical and less idealistic approach to dealing with it is needed and is developing, but too slowly to contain global warming as planned
3. It seems likely that most spending and changes will be directed by those entities that have the money or can produce the profitable investments to adapt to climate change rather than to prevent it.
